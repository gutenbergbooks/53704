<p>Slowly and ponderously the United States
transport, <i>Sherman</i>, moved out of the maze of
boats that had clustered about her at the Brest
dock. With ever-gathering speed she thrust her
prow into the rippling water, leaving behind, on
the wharf, cheering hundreds of Uncle Sam’s
boys who envied the lot of their fellows in thus
sailing for home after the Great War. Mingled
with the resonant voices of the Americans were
the shriller notes of their French comrades, who
were bidding God-speed to their allied comrades.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re really off at last,” remarked a
tall, bronzed youth, speaking to some of his chums
who leaned over the rail with him, waving to
friends on the wharf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Jerry,” remarked a rather stout khaki-clad
soldier lad, “off at last. And now that the
captain can dispense with my valuable services in
warping the ship away from the dock—I believe
warping is the proper word—I’m going to
look——”</p>

<p>“For the kitchen!” interrupted a third member
of the little group clustered about the lad called
Jerry, who wore on his coat the D. S. C. of valor.
“Isn’t that what you were going to say, Bob?”</p>

<p>“What’s that about a kitchen?” asked the youth
called Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bob is up to his old tricks,” remarked
the soldier who had interrupted his friend’s facetious
words.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may be, Ned,” came in reply from
the stout one; “but I know enough not to call the
place on board a ship where food is prepared a
‘kitchen.’ Why don’t you say galley, you land-lubber?”
and with this parting shot Bob Baker,
winking one eye at his tall friend, Jerry Hopkins,
strolled aft.</p>

<p>He was soon lost in the throng of soldiers which
crowded every available part of the transport,
and Ned and Jerry, retaining their places by the
rail, looked down at the water of the harbor which
they were leaving behind. This was one of the
first transports to depart for the United States
after the terrible conflict, and in addition to taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
home a number of unwounded men, it also
carried many casual cases.</p>

<p>Among the former were many friends and comrades
of Jerry Hopkins, Ned Slade, and Bob
Baker, three chums known to many of my readers
as the “Motor Boys,” of whom more will later
be told.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re on our way,” remarked Ned to
Jerry, as the two stood somewhat apart for the
moment, their friends at the rail having moved to
one side. “We’re on our way, and Bob hasn’t
lost much time in starting his favorite indoor
sport.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that I blame him,” announced
Jerry. “The eating problem has been a
hard one for all of us since this war started, and
there’s such a crowd on board that it isn’t likely
to be an easy matter to get a feed now. Bob
always was one who believed in safety first, when
it comes to his stomach.”</p>

<p>“You’re right!” assented Ned. “But there’s
one thing about him: He isn’t mean, and if he
finds a way to get an extra supply of grub he’ll
share it with us.”</p>

<p>“You said a mouthful!” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>For several moments they stood looking at the
gradually disappearing reminders of the late conflict—the
docks and the buildings at the Brest
camp, in France, where they had spent some days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
in waiting for transportation back to the United
States. Then Ned turned to look over the seething
deck.</p>

<p>“This is some crowd!” murmured Ned. “I
hope Bob doesn’t get lost in it.”</p>

<p>“Especially if he does manage to find the galley,
and can bribe or intimidate one of the cooks
into slipping him something on the side,” added
Jerry. “In that case I hope Bob’s memory carries
him back to us, for, to tell you the truth, I’m
hungry.”</p>

<p>“So’m I,” admitted Ned; “though I did pull a
raw one on Chunky. But I guess we ought to
consider ourselves lucky to be on board.”</p>

<p>“You said it!” declared Jerry. “There’s a lot
of the boys who would give up a wound stripe for
the sake of going back on one of these early boats.
Now that the war is practically over, there’s going
to be a big slump in the enthusiasm that kept
us going when nothing else would have done it.
Yes, we’re dead lucky to be going back.”</p>

<p>And so, amid the whistle salutes of other craft,
the waving of hands and the tossing of hats and
caps from unknown well-wishers, the <i>Sherman</i>
kept on her way.</p>

<p>Out toward the west she headed, out toward
the land of the Stars and Stripes, and deep in
their hearts Ned, Bob, and Jerry were thankful
for the Providence that had picked them as among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the first to go back home after the fighting was
over.</p>

<p>They had covered themselves with glory, for
in addition to the D. S. C. bestowed on Jerry
Hopkins, Ned and Bob had received honorable
mention, and their company was one picked out
for signal honor, the three boys sharing in the
general praise.</p>

<p>“I wonder how things are going back in Cresville,”
mused Ned, after a period of silence on
the part of himself and Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s queer! I was just thinking that same
thing myself,” the taller lad exclaimed. “It will
seem mighty quiet after the hail-storms we’ve been
through.”</p>

<p>“Hail-storms is right,” agreed Ned Slade.
“But it can’t be too quiet for me. All I want to
do is to sit under a tree back of the house, with
plenty of books and magazines to read, clean
clothes—real clean clothes—to wear, a bath-tub
where I know where it is, and——”</p>

<p>“Something to eat!” interrupted a voice behind
him, and, turning, Ned and Jerry beheld their
stout chum, Bob Baker, who smilingly held out
some sandwiches.</p>

<p>“Running true to form,” murmured Ned, as
he accepted one, and also a bit of chocolate candy
his friend extended. “How’d you manage to do
it, Bob?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, my hypnotic eye. Just told one of the
cooks I had to have something if they didn’t want
the captain to read the service for burial at sea.
And the cook allowed he didn’t want that to happen
so soon after we’d got started. This is the
result,” and Bob began munching on his share of
the auxiliary rations, an example followed by Ned
and Jerry.</p>

<p>“Am I right?” mumbled Bob, between bites.</p>

<p>“Right-O, Chunky!” murmured Jerry. “This
touches the right spot.”</p>

<p>“Do you accept my amendment regarding the
necessities you require on reaching home, Ned?”
asked Bob, after a period of eloquent silence.</p>

<p>“Amendment accepted, all in favor say ‘aye!’”
exclaimed Ned, adding, a moment later: “The
ayes have it!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t see anything of Professor Snodgrass,
did you?” asked Jerry of his chums, as they disposed
of the last of the sandwiches and chocolate
Bob had procured in some mysterious way.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Ned. “The last I saw of him
was when he had seen to it that Gladys Petersen
and Dorothy Gibbs were safely on their way
home and he was packing up his pictures and
specimens of bugs and things to ship to the college.”</p>

<p>“He said he might possibly join us on this
transport,” said Bob. “And he may be here, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
all we know. Looks as if everybody I ever met
in France is on board.”</p>

<p>“Not that pretty little girl with the black hair
and brown eyes you were so fond of in the restaurant—she
isn’t here, is she?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out!” growled Bob. “You know
what I mean.”</p>

<p>“But did she know what <em>you</em> meant?” asked
Ned pointedly. “You know you never could get
the hang of the French words, and she used to
rip them out like a drygoods clerk tearing off a
yard of muslin.”</p>

<p>“Say, if you fellows think I’m going to rustle
grub for you, and then have you insult me, you’ve
got another guess and a half coming!” cried Bob
hotly—so hotly, in fact, that Jerry quickly interposed.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Bob,” he said quietly, laying
a cautioning hand on Ned’s shoulder. “We two
were just as fond of Marie as you were, only she
seemed to take more of a notion to you than she
did to us.”</p>

<p>This admission apparently brightened Bob visibly,
and his anger slowly died away.</p>

<p>“And, going back to the original subject,” said
Ned, “did either of you see the professor?”</p>

<p>They had not, they admitted.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re not likely to hear from him until
we get across, then,” decided Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not to be long before his words were
disproved.</p>

<p>Gathering speed, the transport moved ahead,
and the craft was approaching the open sea, leaving
behind, in a misty haze, the camp at Brest,
when without warning she suddenly slowed up,
not gradually, as if making a regular stop, but
with a jar and a shudder that seemed to go
through her whole structure.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Bob, as he and his chums
felt the tremors and the vibration.</p>

<p>“Something’s wrong!” said Ned in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Could we have struck a mine?” asked Bob in
a half whisper, as though he feared to start a
panic. “It couldn’t be a sub, could it? I
thought——”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, for in the midst
of it the vessel started on again; but, to the surprise
of all, she began turning slowly back toward
the port she had so recently left.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>SUSPICIONS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Not much imagination is required to picture the
confusion on board the U. S. S. <i>Sherman</i> when she
was turned around and headed for Brest, the port
from which the craft had so recently sailed. And
also it is easy to guess something of the many
and rapid questions that were fired from all directions,
without any counter-barrage in the way of
replies being given.</p>

<p>“What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t they going to let us go home after all?”</p>

<p>“Have the Germans started another war?”</p>

<p>“Did we strike a mine?”</p>

<p>“Has a torpedo hit us?”</p>

<p>The two last were the questions most often
asked, for it was easily within the bounds of possibility
that the craft might have been damaged
by some floating mine, nor was it out of the bounds
of possibility that she might have been torpedoed.
Some German captain of a submarine, not having
heard of the signing of the armistice, or choosing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to ignore it, perhaps pleading ignorance later,
might easily have taken this method of revenge
for the fancied wrongs to the “Fatherland.”</p>

<p>And so it was that on all sides arose the question:</p>

<p>“What has happened?”</p>

<p>But no one answered it. At least the returning
soldiers, among whom were Ned, Bob, and
Jerry, had no one to answer it for them. They
“milled around” on the decks, surging this way
and that until they threatened the equilibrium of
the vessel and the officers had to go among them
ordering them to remain quiet.</p>

<p>“But what has happened, sir?” asked Jerry of
a captain with whom he was on friendly terms.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, exactly. Something seemed to
go wrong with the machinery. But there is no
danger. We are only a short distance from
shore. It is the duty of every one to remain
calm.”</p>

<p>The boys did their best, but the questioning
still persisted and at length Jerry said:</p>

<p>“Fellows, I’m going to find out what the matter
is.”</p>

<p>“I am, too!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“So’m I!” added Bob. “Maybe the galley is
on fire, and——”</p>

<p>“That would be a terrible calamity!” laughed
Jerry, and his laugh seemed to ease the tension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
somewhat. Then he added: “You two boys had
better stay here. If three of us chase around
we’ll be ordered to keep to one spot. But if I
go alone I may be able to manage it.”</p>

<p>“And as soon as you find out what it is come
back and tell us,” begged Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure thing!” promised his tall chum, as he
moved away.</p>

<p>While Jerry is thus endeavoring to learn the
cause of the sudden turning back of the troopship,
readers who are meeting Ned, Bob, and
Jerry for the first time will be told something
more about the lads, so they may seem more like
old acquaintances.</p>

<p>To those readers who have the first book of
this series, entitled “The Motor Boys,” not much
need be said. It need only be stated that the
present series, under the caption “Ned, Bob and
Jerry,” is a continuation of the same characters in
new fields.</p>

<p>Ned Slade was the son of a wealthy department
store-keeper. Bob Baker’s father was a
banker. And Mrs. Julia Hopkins, the mother of
Jerry, was financially interested in several institutions
controlled by Mr. Slade and Mr. Baker.
The youths lived in Cresville, in one of our New
England states, and their interest in locomotion
dated from the days of their early boyhood, when
they owned motor cycles. It was their activities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
on these machines that gained them the appellation
of “Motor Boys.” They later secured an
automobile, and in this they made a trip Overland,
to Mexico, and Across the Plains, as related
in the books bearing those distinctive titles.</p>

<p>Afterward the boys secured a motor boat and
had many voyages, including travel on the Atlantic,
the Pacific, and in Strange Waters. Trips
above the clouds followed in airships of various
makes, and, not satisfied with that, the three
adventurous lads descended to the depths in
submarines.</p>

<p>Following a series of exciting adventures, detailed
at length, there was a conference on the
part of the parents of Ned, Bob and Jerry. It
was decided that the lads had better “buckle
down” to some serious work in life, and, accordingly,
they were sent to college to complete their
educations.</p>

<p>In “The Motor Boys at Boxwood Hall, or,
Ned, Bob and Jerry as Freshmen,” is related the
many jolly times they had and how they helped
to establish a reputation for old Boxwood Hall in
athletics. At Boxwood Hall the three had lots
of fun, as well as doing good work in their studies.
The boys had many obstacles and difficulties to
overcome but how they won out in the end is set
forth in detail in the book.</p>

<p>The three chums spent a summer on a ranch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and then the Great War broke out. Ned, Bob
and Jerry joined the army, and, in due course,
they found themselves fighting Germany. What
happened to them is set forth in the book immediately
preceding this, called “The Motor Boys
on the Firing Line.” More than the details of
many battles is in this volume, for in addition
to fighting for Uncle Sam the Motor Boys
had also to help their friend, Professor Uriah
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>This doughty little scientist was the boys companion
on their many trips, and he not only enjoyed
the companionship of the boys, but he
obtained much information by going with them, not
to mention many valuable, if not always pleasant
specimens. For Professor Snodgrass collected
bugs, snakes and allied creatures for Boxwood
Hall and other colleges and also several museums.</p>

<p>He had gone to Europe with the boys on a
double mission. One was to find two young
ladies—Dorothy Gibbs and Gladys Petersen—nieces
of Professor Petersen’s, and the other was
to get photographs of the effects of war noises on
certain insects.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass found the girls, and, with
the help of the three boys, was able to send them
back to the United States. He also got the pictures
he wanted, and he secured for himself a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
large sum of money. This money had been left
by Professor Petersen to Professor Snodgrass,
provided the latter discovered the whereabouts of
the two young ladies.</p>

<p>Now, with the ending of the war Ned, Bob and
Jerry had started back home on the transport.
Professor Snodgrass, having seen to it that the
nieces of his late friend were safely cared for,
had turned his attention to shipping back the
moving and other pictures he had made of the
insects. The boys had lost sight of him in the
confusion of the preparations for sailing for
home. Professor Snodgrass, however, had said
he might meet the boys on the transport. But,
up to the time of the turning back of the <i>Sherman</i>,
no further word had been received concerning
the little scientist.</p>

<p>Now all was confusion on board the troopship.
In spite of the orders of the officers, the men kept
moving here and there, each one seeking to learn
the cause of the trouble, to find out why they
should be going back to France when they hoped
they had left it for good—and this was saying or
thinking nothing against the country that had
given them such a warm welcome in her hour of
dire distress.</p>

<p>“It’s a fat chance Jerry has of finding out what
the row is,” commented Ned to Bob, as they retained
their places near the crowded rail close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to one of the lifeboats—a position Jerry had assigned
to them as a rendezvous.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Because I just heard our colonel telling the
major he didn’t know what was up.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it isn’t generally known yet,”
said Bob. “If there’s been an accident the captain
of the ship is sure to know about it, even if
he doesn’t tell our colonel right away. You see
the ship captain is in full authority, once the vessel
gets away from the dock. His word is law,
and the military authorities, that had the say on
shore, don’t cut any ice now.”</p>

<p>“Poetically speaking,” added Ned, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” agreed Bob, also grinning. “You
see the safety of the ship depends on the captain,
and you can stake your last doughnut that he
knows what’s up, even if he hasn’t told any of
the military crowd, which includes us—ahem!”
and Bob swelled up his chest. “But you can depend
on it that if anything is to be found out
Jerry will discover it. He has a way with him!”</p>

<p>“Can he find out something our colonel can’t
learn?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“He might. The colonel couldn’t descend to
asking information of a stoker or a coal passer,
but Jerry could, not being of the elect, you know.
Yes, you let Jerry-boy alone, and he’ll come home
with the bacon. And, speaking of bacon, I wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
I had some right now, with some fresh eggs, and
have them with the sunny-sides up. The bacon
nice and crisp, and the coffee just right, with cream
in a little pitcher on the side and——”</p>

<p>“Thud!”</p>

<p>That was Ned giving Bob a thump on the back.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” indignantly demanded
the stout youth.</p>

<p>“Cut out the imaginary eats!” was the answer.
“Haven’t we got troubles enough without that?
But here comes Jerry. Now to see if he has found
out anything!”</p>

<p>The tall lad, on whose coat was the D. S. C.,
sauntered toward his two chums. With a signal
from his eyes—a signal they well knew how to
interpret, Ned and Bob moved to one side. Jerry
had told them, without the use of words, that he
wanted to speak with them alone.</p>

<p>Just then, fortunately for their plans, there was
a little commotion farther up the deck, and in the
rush that followed there was a clear space left
near the rail where the three boys now stood.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” asked Ned, as Jerry looked
first at him and then at Bob. “Are we sinking,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Far from it. The hull is as sound as a dollar.”</p>

<p>“Then it wasn’t a mine or a torpedo?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Not this time. But there has been an accident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to the machinery, and we’re returning to the
dock for repairs.”</p>

<p>“Only an accident to the machinery!” exclaimed
Ned. “Then why, in the name of Andy Rush, all
this mystery and excitement?”</p>

<p>“Because,” answered Jerry slowly, “from what
I heard, the accident was a premeditated one, and
it looks suspicious.”</p>

<p>“Suspicious!” exclaimed his two chums.</p>

<p>“Hush! Yes! But not so loud. That’s why
I gave you the high sign to let me have a word
alone with you. There’s a rumor that some revengeful
German may have set off a time bomb
in the engine room. So far the damage is slight,
but——”</p>

<p>Jerry paused, for another tremor ran through
the ship and again the vessel came to a sudden
stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>THE LITTLE MAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Say, this is getting a bit more than interesting!”
cried Ned, as he and Bob gazed at Jerry.</p>

<p>The stout lad looked up at the lifeboat near
which he leaned on the rail.</p>

<p>“None of that!” warned Jerry. “Don’t start
a rush. There’s no danger!”</p>

<p>But his words did not seem to be borne out,
for no sooner was it apparent to all on board that
the <i>Sherman</i> had come to a stop again than a sort
of panic began which the officers had to work hard
to subdue. Finally the colonel commanding the
troops had to make an address from the main
deck.</p>

<p>“There is absolutely no danger!” he declared.
“The captain assures me the ship is not leaking a
drop, and we shall soon be back at the dock
whence we started. This is unfortunate, but it
can not be helped. We shall start for home again
as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“When will that be, sir?” some soldier asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
While another—more than one, in fact—inquired
as to the cause of the trouble.</p>

<p>“There has been an accident to the machinery,”
the colonel stated. “One of the engines is
disabled, and that puts all the work on the remaining
unit. I am told that this excess caused
a temporary stoppage of the one good engine.
But we shall soon be under way again.”</p>

<p>“Was there an explosion?” some one asked.</p>

<p>“A slight one, yes,” was the rather hesitating
answer.</p>

<p>“What caused it?”</p>

<p>“Did we hit a mine?”</p>

<p>“Was it a Boche?”</p>

<p>These were only a few of the questions, hurled
like hand grenades, at the colonel.</p>

<p>“I am not at liberty to say what caused the
explosion,” he announced. “It can not be told at
present. All I ask of you—all that your officers
ask of you—is that you remain quiet. We shall
soon start again, to be quickly back at the dock.”</p>

<p>“For how long?” asked several.</p>

<p>That seemed to strike a popular chord.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, but I am unable to answer that
question,” replied the colonel with a smile. “I
know you all want it answered, and I will say
that if it is found it will require too long to repair
the damage to this transport another will be provided.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a cheer at this, and the colonel and
his staff looked relieved. The danger of a panic
and a rush for the boats seemed past. But many
rumors were still in circulation, and that of a
German spy or some Hun sympathizer having
tried to sink the transport and the troops gained
each hour.</p>

<p>It seemed a very long time, though it was not
more than two hours, before the ship was under
way again. But she limped along under less than
half steam, and many anxious hearts were glad
when the dock they had recently left loomed in
sight again.</p>

<p>The accident, of whatever nature it was, had
happened when the <i>Sherman</i> was not far from
shore, and, even had it been necessary to launch
the lifeboats and rafts, it is probable that all on
board would have been saved.</p>

<p>But there was always danger, especially when
the wounded men were considered, and there were
not a few of them on board. Consequently, it
was with a feeling of relief that all observed the
craft being warped back to the berth she had so
lately left.</p>

<p>“Now the question arising is: What——”</p>

<p>“Are we going to eat, and when!” interrupted
Ned, breaking in on what Bob had started to say.</p>

<p>“As you were! As you were!” growled the
stout lad. “I wasn’t going to say that at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
What I mean is: ‘What’s going to happen to
us? Shall we have to stay cooped up on board
when there’s peace and plenty and room to move
about on shore?’”</p>

<p>“Not to mention Marie, of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le restaurant de la
palma</i> or something like that,” mocked Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s right—keep on picking at me!”
mourned Bob. “But you guys’ll be just as glad
as I shall be to get off this tub if she isn’t moving
toward the U. S. A.”</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right,” assented Jerry. “It isn’t
going to be much fun cooped up here if we’re
going to stay tied to the dock. It’s too crowded.
Wouldn’t be so bad if we were at sea and knew
we were moving toward home. But if we have to
hang around this dock it will give me the willies!”</p>

<p>“You said another mouthful!” agreed Ned.
“But it’s a good thing this accident didn’t happen
when we were three or four days out. And maybe
they’ll let us go ashore.”</p>

<p>This hope was realized, at least on the part of
the Motor Boys, a little later. Once the <i>Sherman</i>
was made fast to the dock again, there were numerous
petitions from the privates to their officers
for permission to go ashore, if only for a few
hours. Ned, Bob, and Jerry made their requests,
and, to their delight, they were granted. Perhaps
Jerry’s D. S. C. and the honors attained by
Ned and Bob had something to do with this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you must not go far away, and you must
report back here on board in three hours,” their
captain told them. “It is thought the repairs will
be completed by then.”</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums were closely scrutinized
and their passes examined with care when they
walked down the gangplank to the dock. All who
were allowed to go on shore were thus observed,
and as the three friends passed out to the streets
of the city which had loomed so large of late as
the location of the camp of much rain and mud,
they noted that the sentries had been doubled
around the wharf of the <i>Sherman</i>.</p>

<p>“If there’s a German spy on board he’ll stand
a fat chance if they find him,” said Bob, as he
and his chums started off on their leave.</p>

<p>The three boys headed at once for a restaurant,
for the emergency rations which Bob had,
somehow, managed to secure had long since lost
their effects. And, for a wonder, Ned and Jerry
did not twit their stout companion with being
over-zealous in his desire for food. They wanted
it as much as he did.</p>

<p>Moreover, they went to the restaurant where
the pretty Marie waited on one of the tables.
Bob had discovered this “life-saving station” in
the midst of his wanderings about Brest, and after
some persuasion on the part of his chums had let
them into the secret of it. Thereafter they spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
much of their leave-time in this place. Now again
they headed for it.</p>

<p>And Marie was there. She welcomed the boys
with a smile. With smiles, in fact; for though
Bob claimed it as his right to bask in them to the
exclusion of all others, Marie, in reality, smiled
impartially on her “three musketeers.”</p>

<p>“Back so soon?” she asked, with her fascinating
accent and pronunciation.</p>

<p>“Yes. Couldn’t stay away from you, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma’m’sell</i>,”
returned Bob, trying to catch Marie’s eyes
in a glance that meant more than words.</p>

<p>“What’s that? What’s she got to sell?” asked
Ned, winking at Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out! That’s an old one,” replied
Bob. “I can speak as good French as you.”</p>

<p>“Better, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>, much better!” laughed Jerry.
“Now you two old roosters stop kidding and get
down to business. We have only three hours’
shore leave, so let’s make the most of it. What
have you to eat, Marie?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking!” commented Ned. “Bob
can live on love if he likes, as for me, give
me——”</p>

<p>“Liberty or death!” chanted Bob.</p>

<p>They all laughed gaily, and Marie was told, in
a casual way, of the accident to the troopship and
her trip back to the dock.</p>

<p>The boys were so taken up with the pretty waitress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and with getting their appetites in a fair way
to be satisfied, that they paid little attention to
those around them at the other tables. But when
they had begun to eat, and the sharp edge of their
hunger was somewhat dulled, Jerry looked about
the restaurant to note the possible presence of
some of their friends who, like themselves, might
have also received shore leave from the <i>Sherman</i>.</p>

<p>Jerry did not see any soldiers whom he and his
chums knew, though he did observe a number of
Uncle Sam’s boys, together with some French
poilus and British Tommies. What attracted his
attention, however, was the sight of a little bald-headed
man seated at a table two or three removed
from the one at which he and his friends
were dining. The little man was in civilian
clothes.</p>

<p>“Look!” excitedly exclaimed Jerry, nudging
Ned, who sat next to him. “Look over there!”</p>

<p>He pointed to the little bald-headed man, who
was busy over his soup.</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass!” exclaimed Ned. “Well,
this is luck!”</p>

<p>Jerry arose from his chair, followed by Ned,
and started toward the man to whom he had
called the attention of his chums. The man’s back
was toward the lads, but there was no doubt in
their minds that he was their scientific friend.</p>

<p>“Where have you been, Professor Snodgrass?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
asked Jerry, as, with Ned, he stood at the other
table.</p>

<p>And then the two boys received the surprise of
their lives. For the little man who gazed quickly
up at them was not Professor Snodgrass at all,
though he bore a wonderfully striking resemblance
to him from the back.</p>

<p>But more strange than the fact of his being the
professor’s double (which was not so pronounced
when his face was seen) was the action of the
little man. His face turned red with rage, and
he fairly spluttered as he rose from his chair,
facing Jerry and Ned, and exclaiming:</p>

<p>“What do you mean? How dare you call me
Professor Snodgrass? How dare you insult me?
I shall complain to the manager! How dare
you?”</p>

<p>Highly indignant, he motioned to Jerry and Ned
to move back, and, hardly knowing what they
were doing, they retreated, while the eyes of all
in the restaurant were turned on them.</p>

<p>Jerry Hopkins was the first of the three chums
to regain his composure and take the situation in
hand. Quietly he motioned to Ned to fall back,
and, at the same time, nodded to Bob not to approach,
as the stout youth seemed about to do.
The two soldiers had had enough experience with
Jerry’s method in an emergency to be willing to
let him manage matters now.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? What do you mean?”
spluttered the little man, who, from the back, had
so closely resembled Professor Snodgrass. “How
dare you insult me?”</p>

<p>“There seems to be some mistake,” said Jerry,
trying to keep his voice under control, for, truth
to tell, he was as indignant as his chums were at
the unwarranted assumption on the part of the
stranger.</p>

<p>“Mistake? I should say there had been!” was
the exclamation from the little man. “You made
a mistake in thinking I had anything to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
with that—that charlatan! That pretender! That
scientific faker, who calls himself ‘Professor’
Snodgrass. A mistake indeed!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! Wait a minute!” broke in
Ned, unable longer to hear his friend thus abused.
“The mistake will be on the other foot in a minute
if you keep on that way!” he said indignantly.</p>

<p>The little man seemed about to rise from the
table to attack Ned, but Jerry gently thrust back
his impetuous chum.</p>

<p>“Let me handle him,” he whispered to Ned.</p>

<p>“Is he crazy?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It begins to look that way,” answered Jerry,
as the little man resumed his seat at his table,
though he did not continue his meal.</p>

<p>“We wish to apologize for having mistaken
you for a friend of ours,” said Jerry suavely.
“Seeing you from the back we took you to be
Professor Snodgrass, and——”</p>

<p>“Is <em>he</em> a friend of yours?” asked the little man
fiercely.</p>

<p>“He certainly is!” exclaimed Bob truculently.</p>

<p>“Well, all I have to say is that I am sorry for
you,” said the little man. “You had no right to
assume that I was he, and your effrontery in publicly
addressing me as such needs to be apologized
for.”</p>

<p>“Which we are doing,” said Jerry stiffly. “And
I might add,” he went on, “that if you continue in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
your present strain there will be something else to
apologize for, and not on our part, either!” He
seemed quite a different Jerry now.</p>

<p>“We have made proper reparation for having
mistaken you for our friend, Professor Snodgrass,”
he continued, “and that, to a <em>gentleman</em>,
should be sufficient. I think that is all, sir!”</p>

<p>Jerry turned stiffly and marched back to his own
table, followed by Ned and Bob, who had left
their seats to join him. For a few seconds the
little bald-headed man did not seem to know what
to do. He said something about its being “all
right now,” but mingled with this were grunts and
mutterings about “insolent puppies,” which words,
however, Jerry and his chums thought best to ignore.</p>

<p>“Say, what was eating him, anyhow?” asked
Bob, when they had resumed their seats for their
dessert which the pretty Marie was then bringing
to them.</p>

<p>“I guess you mean what had he been eating,”
said Ned. “Red pepper and <i>chili con carne</i> I imagine,
with a dish of tabasco sauce and <i>frijoles</i>
on the side.”</p>

<p>“Reminds me of our Mexico trip,” interposed
Bob. “What was the name of that Spanish fellow
who was always making so much trouble?”</p>

<p>“You mean Vasco Bilette,” suggested Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s it! This fellow, who really looks a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
lot like our dear, old professor, certainly is
touchy.”</p>

<p>“He certainly is,” agreed Jerry. “Say, Bob,”
he went on, “you claim you can <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parlez-vous</i> better
than the rest of us. Suppose you ask Marie if
she knows this duck.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” assented the stout lad. “Say, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chere</i>
Marie,” he went on as the pretty little waitress
came up to their table, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comprehendez-vous</i> him?”
and he pointed to the man who was the cause of
the Motor Boys’ discomfiture. For it had been
disquieting, to say the least, to have the eyes of
all in the restaurant turned on them during the
fracas, as Ned termed it.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comprehendez-vous</i> him?” asked Bob of
Marie. “You know. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La petite hommes de la
table d’hote</i>,” and to make sure that his “French”
would be understood he pointed to the little man.</p>

<p>“Say, what’s that you’re getting off?” demanded
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m asking her if she’s wise to the guy who’s
eating in this restaurant,” translated Bob. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comprehendez</i>—that
means ‘do you know.’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La petite</i>—that
means ‘little’ and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hommes</i> means ‘man.’”</p>

<p>“He’s right there,” declared Ned earnestly,
while Marie looked amusedly at “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les trois mousquetaires</i>.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” snapped Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why, isn’t it painted all over the cars we’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
been riding in, ‘chevaux 8—hommes 40’? That is
eight horses or forty men. Sure <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hommes</i> mean
men, or man.”</p>

<p>“Watch Bob swell up,” commented Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, you told me to spout French, and I’m
doing it,” said the lad with the perpetual appetite.
“Now give her a chance to answer. I’ll ask
her again. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chere Marie! Comprehendez-vous
la petite hommes de la table d’hote?</i>”</p>

<p>The pretty waitress placed on the table the
dishes she had brought up to serve, turned for a
look over her shoulder at the man Bob referred
to, and then looked back, with a smile, at the
stout lad and his chums.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui</i>,” she answered, guessing shrewdly at
Bob’s meaning and shrugging her shoulders expressively.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! So she does know him!” exclaimed
Ned, for in spite of the fact that they let Bob
assert his knowledge of French, they could not
help acquiring some of the words, and that “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oui</i>”
meant “yes” had been one of their first acquisitions.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“She can’t understand that,” declared Bob.
“Wait, I’ll translate it to her.” Then, laboriously
he said: “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le nom des hommes? Comprehendez-vous?</i>”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Ned wanted to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m asking her if she knows his name,” replied
Bob.</p>

<p>They looked anxiously at Marie. Again she
turned and glanced at the little man who had
waxed so indignant at being taken for Professor
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cochon!</i>” exclaimed Marie, and she seemed to
snap out the word as a second lieutenant issues his
commands to the awkward squad.</p>

<p>“What did she say?” chorused Ned and Jerry.</p>

<p>Bob was nonplussed. He scratched his head
and then repeated the word to Marie.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cochon?</i>” he asked.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cochon! Cochon!</i>” was the swift answer.
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui! Cochon des cochons!</i>”</p>

<p>“Um!” murmured Bob.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence, during which
Marie moved off to serve another table.</p>

<p>“Well, what is he, a German spy?” asked Ned.
“If he is, he has his nerve with him—showing up
here after the armistice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, tell us what she said,” begged Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well,” returned Bob slowly, “you know the
French language is very queer. It isn’t like any
other language.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we know that all right!” exclaimed Ned.
“You needn’t tell us that. Even though you may
know a lot more about it than we do, it hasn’t
taken us six months to appreciate the fact that it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
a mighty elusive way of conversing. But what I
want to know, and what Jerry wants to know, is:
What did Marie say that pepper-hash guy was?”</p>

<p>“Well,” confessed Bob, “that’s just it. If the
French language didn’t have so many words in it
that sound a lot alike, but mean a lot of different
things, I could be sure. She called him a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cochon</i>.”</p>

<p>“A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cochon</i> of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cochon</i>,” added Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what she did,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, but what is a cochon?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s either a pig or a coachman,” said Bob,
desperately. “That’s the trouble. I’m not sure
which. I forget whether <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocher</i> is pig or whether
it’s coachman, and I don’t know whether <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cochon</i>
is coachman or pig. I know it’s one or the other,
but just now I sort of forget.”</p>

<p>“A heap of good your French does us!” laughed
Jerry. “If she said he was a coachman it might
mean he was a respectable, though humble, member
of society. If, on the other hand, she called
him a pig, it might mean he had something to do
with starting this war. Now which is it?”</p>

<p>Bob scratched his head again. Plainly, he was
“stumped.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask her again when she comes back,” he
said. “I wish I had my French book here. I
sort of think that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cochon</i> means pig, and, in that
case——”</p>

<p>“Well, he certainly acted like a pig, so we’ll let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
it go at that,” declared Jerry. “The idea of getting
on his ear just because we happened to mistake
him for Professor Snodgrass!”</p>

<p>“And he did look a lot like him from the back,”
declared Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure,” assented Bob. “I wonder where the
dear old chap is, anyhow? I wish he were going
back with us.”</p>

<p>“Not much chance of that,” said Jerry. “He
said he’d like to, and he really started back, but
he received word to take up some other line of
scientific investigation before he left to go back
to Boxwood Hall, and you can wager your last
cartridge that he’ll do it. But this man seems to
have some sort of grudge against him, taking us
up the way he did.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned. “Say, Bob, you’ll
have to tackle your friend Marie again. See if
you can’t find out more about this duck.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Bob. “I’ll speak to her as
soon as she comes back. It might be, you know,
that this fellow is some relation to the Germans
the professor captured.”</p>

<p>“Not much chance of that,” declared Jerry.
“This <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocher</i> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cochon</i> doesn’t seem a bit like a
Hun.”</p>

<p>“You never can tell,” remarked Ned. “We’d
better find out all we can about him while we have
the chance. If Professor Snodgrass is going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
remain here it would be a good thing for him to
know about this guy.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Marie now,” said Jerry. “Go at
her again, Bob, and see if she can’t speak English.”</p>

<p>“I will,” agreed the stout youth.</p>

<p>When Marie again approached their table, in
response to a beckoning signal, Bob began:</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marie, de la cochon la petite cocher est
le——</i>”</p>

<p>“Oh, for cats’ sake!” cried Ned, “you’ll be
worse tangled than before. Can’t you get some
American words? Here, let me——”</p>

<p>But at that moment there came an interruption
in the person of a member of the American military
police who, thrusting his head into the restaurant,
called:</p>

<p>“Anybody here that’s booked to go on the <i>Sherman</i>
had better hike back to the dock. She’s going
to sail soon.”</p>

<p>“Has the machinery been repaired?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes! She’s getting ready to sail. You fellows
going on her?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, you lucky dogs!” sighed the other. “Well,
get a move on. We got orders to round up everybody
that had shore leave,” and with a friendly
wave of his hand he departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Jerry, gathering up a few
possessions, an example followed by the others.</p>

<p>“I’ll pay the bill,” said Ned, taking a handful
of change out of his pocket.</p>

<p>“Where’s Marie?” asked Bob. “I want
to——”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind finding out what <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cochon</i>
means!” exclaimed Jerry. “We don’t want to be
left!”</p>

<p>“I want to say good-bye!” declared Bob, indignantly.
“And I was going to ask her if she could
put us up some sandwiches.”</p>

<p>“Cupboard love!” laughed Ned. “Come on!
Move lively!”</p>

<p>“The pepper-hash individual is moving, too,”
commented Jerry, as they left the restaurant, having
noted that the man who had so resented being
taken for Professor Snodgrass was also settling
his bill.</p>

<p>“Well, if he doesn’t run into us again I’ll be
thankful,” remarked Jerry. “He sure did make
me feel like twenty-nine cents when he turned on
me the way he did.”</p>

<p>Quickly the three chums made their way back
to the dock to which the <i>Sherman</i> had returned.
They saw others on the same errand. The repair
work had been completed sooner than was expected,
and now the siren of the vessel was blowing to
call back those who had been allowed shore leave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Fortunately each one, when being granted permission
to “stretch his legs,” had been told to hold
himself in readiness, and none had gone far away.</p>

<p>The Motor Boys were soon on board again,
and after a slight delay the transport was again
moving slowly from the dock.</p>

<p>“Off again!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes; and let’s hope with better luck!” added
Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry looked about the crowded deck. As he
did so he gave a start, and grasped the arm of
Ned.</p>

<p>“Look!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned. “See a ghost?”</p>

<p>“No, but if that isn’t our peppery friend of the
restaurant—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>—I’ll do K. P. for a week!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>THE NIGHT ATTACK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Instantly Ned and Bob turned to look in the
direction indicated by Jerry. Both the tall lad’s
chums saw the individual referred to as “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
cochon</i>.”</p>

<p>“It’s him all right!” asserted Bob, with complete
disregard for the rules of grammar.</p>

<p>“But what’s he doing here?” demanded Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d like to know,” said Jerry in
a low voice. “It can’t be that he feels so indignant
at us for having honestly mistaken him for
Professor Snodgrass that he has followed us
here.”</p>

<p>“If he has,” voiced Ned, “he’ll find we have
our gang with us, and he’d better watch his step!”</p>

<p>“We’ll take no more of his insults,” declared
Bob. “I’ve a good notion to go up to him now
and ask him what his game is.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t!” interposed Jerry, as his stout
chum seemed about to put this into execution.
“Let’s lay low for a while, and see what we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
find out. No use starting anything. We’ve had
trouble enough already.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” chimed in Ned. “There’s been
enough of a hoodoo about this homeward trip.
Let’s get out to sea before we tackle <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>.
Then he can’t dodge us by getting off and walking
ashore.”</p>

<p>“He’s going below, anyhow,” remarked Jerry,
as they saw the little man descending a companionway.
“He must feel at home. I didn’t know
they allowed any civilians to travel on the troopships.”</p>

<p>“They’ve made an exception in his case,” decided
Jerry. “Well, it is queer, and I’d like to
know what it all means. This man is an American,
by his talk, but he isn’t at all like our dear old
professor, no matter how much he looks like him
from the rear.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see the professor once more,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>“Same here,” agreed Bob. “Well, we’ll see
him, I suppose, when we get back home. Gee!
After what we’ve gone through it hardly seems as
if there is any such a place.”</p>

<p>“You said a mouthful, buddy!” exclaimed a tall
soldier who wore the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">croix de guerre</i>. “I’d rather
see my back yard with the sunflowers and the hollyhocks
in it than all the gardens of the too-de-loories
over here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Sherman</i> was now again rapidly leaving
the harbor of Brest and making her way toward
the open sea.</p>

<p>“There isn’t going to be much of a joy-ride
about this,” observed Ned, as he and his chums
found their sleeping quarters and stowed away
their few belongings.</p>

<p>“No; it’s too crowded,” decided Bob. “There
isn’t much more elbow room than we had in the
trenches.”</p>

<p>“Trenches!” exclaimed Jerry. “Don’t name
’em!”</p>

<p>Any one who heard, saw, or had any experience
in connection with the return of the first of
our fighting forces back to their homes need not
be told that the transports were no place for a
comfortable voyage. While everything possible
was done to insure the comfort of the soldiers,
the first requisite was to bring back as many as
possible in the shortest possible time, and also
transport as many casualties as could safely and
comfortably be accommodated. The recovered,
or partly recovered, wounded were the first consideration,
and none of the soldiers who were
comparatively well and strong, even though some
of them had been in hospitals, begrudged an inch
of space that went to make life easier for those
who had lost an arm, a leg, who were suffering
from the effects of gas or shell shock, or who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
among the most terribly afflicted—some being
blinded.</p>

<p>So, as Bob said, the transport was no place for
joy-riding. There was such a crowd that the soldiers
had to stand up to eat, many of them, and
they were glad of a place to sleep. They could
not move around much on the boat, big as it was.</p>

<p>“Now we’re really on our way at last!” exclaimed
Bob to his chums. “And do you know
what I think will be the best thing to do?”</p>

<p>“I can make a pretty good guess,” laughed Ned.
“It has something to do with eating, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t get fresh,” advised the stout lad. “You
may be thankful to me, later, for suggesting this.”</p>

<p>“What were you going to say, Chunky?” asked
Jerry. “Go on, tell me! Don’t mind the shrimp!”</p>

<p>“Well, I was going to say it would be a good
thing if we located the place at the lunch counter
where we’ll be handed our rations,” suggested
Bob. “They’ll be giving the mess call soon, and
if we know where to fall in, and the shortest route
to the dining car, so much the better.”</p>

<p>“Not such a bad suggestion at that,” commented
Jerry. “We’ll do it, old top!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you said something—for once,” conceded
Ned.</p>

<p>Accordingly, led by Bob, who might perhaps
qualify as an expert in the matter of eating, the
three lads asked their way about the troopship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
until they found where their particular company
would be fed, and at about what time.</p>

<p>“About an hour more!” sighed Bob, as he looked
at his wrist watch.</p>

<p>“Listen to him!” cried Ned. “And it’s only a
little while ago that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la belle Marie</i> was feeding
him!”</p>

<p>“It’s the sea air!” confessed Bob. “It always
did make me hungry!”</p>

<p>There was not a great deal to do on board the
<i>Sherman</i>—at least during the first day of the
homeward-bound voyage. The soldiers stood
about on deck, or sought such sheltered places as
they could find, and smoked, played cards, talked
or read. Later on some entertainments might be
gotten up, it was said. But the wounded required
the attention of the nurses and the doctors, and
the well and strong were well able to shift for
themselves.</p>

<p>Bob’s wisdom in finding out in advance where
they were to assemble at mess call proved to be a
commendable bit of forethought. For while some
of the soldiers hurried here and there in what
approached confusion, the three chums got in line,
and with a few other knowing ones were among
the first to be fed.</p>

<p>“Chunky, we’ve got to hand it to you!” complimented
Jerry, as he cleaned his plate. “You
sure are one good little feeder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I take back all I said,” added Ned. “You
may come to my party, Bob, when I have it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” murmured the stout one, smiling between
bites.</p>

<p>After the dinner mess there was nothing to do
until the middle of the afternoon, when word went
around that there was to be boat drill. That is,
each man was to be told where his station was, and
what boat he was to try to get into in case of danger.
This program held for two days of ocean
travel, until some began to complain of too many
boat drills.</p>

<p>But, in spite of the fact that the war was over,
there was a chance that a floating mine might be
struck.</p>

<p>Following the short boat drill, Ned, Bob, and
Jerry came back to a comfortable place they had
preempted on the after deck, and they were sitting
there talking when Bob nudged Jerry, who was
nearest him, and whispered:</p>

<p>“There he is again!”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked the tall lad.</p>

<p>“The pepper-pot,” was the answer. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le cochon!</i>”</p>

<p>As he spoke he nodded toward a secluded and
shadowed corner. There, staring at the three
boys, they could make out the little bald-headed
man of the restaurant. He was peering at them
through his spectacles over the top of what to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
boys seemed to be a pamphlet and which he was
holding just below the level of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, he’ll know us again, anyhow,” mused
Jerry. And then, as if conscious that he was under
observation and had been detected in spy work,
the peculiar individual hastily turned and went
below.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what his game is!” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>“So would I!” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to keep watch,” said Bob. “He
seems to have it in for us.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see if we can find out something about
him,” suggested Ned. “We can ask some of our
officers, and, if they don’t know, maybe they can
find out from the ship’s captain. It may be this
fellow is a German spy, or at least a Hun sympathizer,
who would like to play some mean trick on
those who put the ‘Fatherland’ on the blink.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s see if we can get a line on him,”
agreed Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry was about to assent to this when the three
chums were approached by a group of their comrades
who wanted them to join a party that was
going to call on some of the wounded who were
below decks. This was done, and, for the time
being, the queer little bald-headed man was forgotten.</p>

<p>Indeed the minds of the Motor Boys did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
revert to him until late that night when they were
turning in, and then Jerry said:</p>

<p>“We’ll make some inquiries in the morning.”</p>

<p>The boys were tired enough to sleep soundly,
even though their beds were not as comfortable as
those oftentimes they had stretched out on when
in some camp. But they were too happy over
going home to find fault, and soon all were asleep,
as were hundreds all around them.</p>

<p>It was shortly after midnight, Jerry declared
later, stating that he had glanced at his radium-faced
wrist watch, when the midnight attack took
place. And it was made on Bob. He was sleeping
between Ned and Jerry, and they were
awakened by hearing the stout lad yell.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded Jerry, suddenly
awakening and instinctively glancing at his
watch. “What is it, Bob?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got him! I’ve got him!” cried a voice
savagely, and the tones were not those of Chunky.
Then followed the sound of a struggle.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>A STRANGE ENCOUNTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Instantly all was in confusion in that part
of the sleeping quarters where the three friends
were berthed. Jerry leaped up, followed by Ned,
and the tall lad flashed on the scene the gleam
from his pocket electric torch.</p>

<p>He saw a strange sight. Bob was struggling
in the grasp of a white-robed figure. The two
were tumbling about, each one seemingly trying
to get an advantageous grip on the other. And
all the while the figure in white was shouting:</p>

<p>“I’ve got him! I’ve got him! I’ll kill him now!
I’ve got him!”</p>

<p>While Bob, exerting himself to the utmost,
could only gasp:</p>

<p>“Let up now! What’s the matter! Ned!
Jerry! He’s killing me!”</p>

<p>Ned’s answer to this appeal was to leap on the
back of the man who had Bob in what might prove
to be a death-grip, while Jerry moved about to
get in position where he, too, could help his chum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Meanwhile, the tall lad kept his pocket electric
lamp glowing.</p>

<p>“Who is he? What’s he fighting you for,
Bob?” cried Jerry, while many other soldiers,
awakened by the commotion, gathered about the
struggling twain.</p>

<p>The only answer from the stout youth was a
grunt, and a gasp.</p>

<p>“It’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>!” cried Ned. “That’s who it
is! The same fellow who acted so rotten in the
restaurant, Jerry! He’s trying to kill Bob! He
must be crazy!”</p>

<p>At first, as Jerry admitted afterward, this was
his thought also. But a second look at Bob’s midnight
assailant told a different story. This man
had a shock of red hair, while the other had been
almost bald. And there was a great difference
in the physique of the two.</p>

<p><a href="#image02">Ned was doing his best to pull the fellow away
from Bob</a> by a rear attack, and to this end Jerry
likewise lent his aid. Other soldiers also joined
in to separate the two struggling ones, and they
worked to such good advantage that the desperate
grip on Bob’s throat was broken, his attacker
pulled away and his arms held behind him.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_46">NED WAS DOING HIS BEST TO PULL THE FELLOW AWAY

</div>

<p>“Why it’s Meldon!” some one shouted. “It’s
Meldon of the Twenty-seventh. He was in the
hospital!”</p>

<p>And Meldon, if that was the name of the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in white pajamas, looked wonderingly about him,
passed his hand over his eyes as if in a daze, and
murmured:</p>

<p>“Where am I? What happened?”</p>

<p>“Lots happened, old man,” answered Ned, himself
panting from the violence of the struggle.</p>

<p>“Are you all right, Bob?” he asked his chum.</p>

<p>Bob carefully and tenderly felt of his throat
before answering.</p>

<p>“I—I guess so,” he replied, after a pause.
“But what’s the idea of giving me the once-over
like that?” he demanded of his assailant.</p>

<p>The latter acted most strangely. He looked
from one to the other of those about him, including
those who held him tightly, and again, he
passed his hand over his forehead, one arm having
been released when it was seen that he was going
to offer no more resistance.</p>

<p>At that moment, when every one was wondering
what it all meant, a nurse came hurrying in.</p>

<p>“Here he is!” she called to a doctor who followed.
“Is he hurt?” she asked the soldiers about
the pajama-clad one.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Jerry. “But he came
near——”</p>

<p>“Did he attack any one?” interposed the surgeon
quickly.</p>

<p>“You might call it that,” answered Bob, with an
attempt at a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just what I feared!” exclaimed the medical
man. “We’ll have to keep him under closer
restraint.”</p>

<p>“Who is he, sir?” asked Jerry, saluting the surgeon,
who bore the rank of major. “All we know
is that we heard a commotion in the dark, and
found my chum here, Bob Baker, struggling with
this man.”</p>

<p>“Meldon is a private suffering from shell
shock,” answered the doctor. “He has violent
spells, and then gets up and imagines he’s attacking
a German.”</p>

<p>The soldier in pajamas seemed to have become
completely quiet now. He gently shook himself
loose from those holding him, and, advancing to
Bob, held out his hand.</p>

<p>“I’m all kinds of sorry, old man,” he said in a
cultured voice. “These spells come on me before
I know it, but they’re getting less frequent. All
I know is that I went to sleep in my usual berth
and woke up having a dickens of a fight. I can’t
tell you how sorry I am. But it must have come on
me in my sleep, and I thought I was back again
fighting the Huns.”</p>

<p>“Well, as long as you did your share of that
I’ll call it square,” said Bob, with a laugh. “At
first I thought you were——”</p>

<p>He stopped, with a significant look at Ned and
Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you think I was a Boche, too?” asked the
soldier who had caused the commotion.</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly,” Bob answered slowly, for
he had been about to say that he had thought
his assailant was none other than the queer little
man—a thought shared by Ned and Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope it doesn’t happen again,” said
the afflicted one. “And I’m sure it won’t. I’m
getting better, I know.”</p>

<p>“We’ll keep him a little more confined than we
have been doing,” said the doctor to Jerry and
his friends, when the nurse had led away the shell-shocked
individual. “This is the second or third
time he has gotten loose in the night and started
a fight. Fortunately, none of them ended seriously.
Better let me look you over,” the medical
major suggested to Bob. “He didn’t bite you anywhere,
did he?”</p>

<p>“Not a bite!” answered Bob, with a laugh.
“Though he did gouge me a bit on the neck.”</p>

<p>Bob’s throat was scratched by the other’s finger
nails, and an antiseptic wash was applied to
prevent any possible bad effect. Then such quiet
as was possible under the circumstances replaced
the midnight excitement.</p>

<p>“At first I thought it was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>,” remarked
Ned in a low voice to his chums, as they turned
in to get what sleep they could.</p>

<p>“That was my first idea when I awoke and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
found him choking me,” admitted Bob. “Though
I couldn’t form any good reason why he should
want to put me out of business.”</p>

<p>“There’s something queer about <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>,” declared
Jerry. By common consent the boys had
adopted that name for the strange little man.
“Why should he be on board here where no civilians—or
at least none unless specially qualified—are
permitted? And why should he have
such a feeling against Professor Snodgrass?”</p>

<p>“Those are questions I’d like to have answered,”
said Ned. “Did either of you ever hear our professor
speak of an individual who somewhat resembled
him?”</p>

<p>“If he ever knew such to be a fact,” declared
Jerry, “he’d never give it a thought or remember
to tell us. All he thinks of is bugs, bugs, and
then more bugs.”</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right,” assented Bob. “But this
man must know our professor, and also have no
liking for him, or he wouldn’t have called him
such names as he did.”</p>

<p>“We oughtn’t to have stood for that!” said
Ned vigorously.</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Jerry. “But it was better to let
the thing go as it did. No use having too much
of a row. Now let’s go to sleep. I’m tired.”</p>

<p>Next day the <i>Sherman</i> was many miles further
out to sea on her homeward-bound voyage. Jerry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and his chums inquired for the soldier who had
attacked Bob, and learned that he was progressing
toward recovery as well as could be expected.</p>

<p>It was the third day out that, as Ned, Bob and
Jerry were coming back from the “sick bay,”
or hospital, where they had been to call on Meldon,
and when they were walking along a dimly-lighted
passage, they saw some one approaching them.
As the passage was narrow they all squeezed back
against the wall to let the person who was nearing
them pass. But the latter, at the sight of the
three boys, seemed to change his plans.</p>

<p>Instead of passing he turned suddenly, and, with
a muttered exclamation, swung back. Not before,
however, Jerry had time to notice that he
carried a black object under one arm. And as
soon as the tall lad observed this Ned exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What’s that funny smell? Isn’t it like a burning
fuse?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>A MIDNIGHT BLAST</small></h2>
</div>


<p>To Ned, Bob, and Jerry, as well as to other
soldiers who had taken part in the Great War,
the word “fuse” referred to but one thing, and
that was the explosion which usually followed the
lighting of it. The lads were familiar with many
kind of fuses, from the ordinary time one, the
most common form of which is the fizzing string
attached to a firecracker, to the complicated fuses
in the big shells. These may be set to explode
the shell at any height, or at any time desired.</p>

<p>And when Ned, sniffing the air suspiciously,
spoke of a fuse, his two companions understood at
once what he meant. But Jerry perhaps because
he did not want to cause an alarm, or it may have
been because he really believed what he said, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Fuse, my eye! That’s cigar smoke you
smell!”</p>

<p>“Then all I have to say is that it’s a pretty poor
specimen of cigar,” retorted Ned. “Must be one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of the substitute tobacco ones the Germans had to
use. Cigar! My word, old top! I’m glad I
don’t smoke if they have to inhale that sort of
stuff.”</p>

<p>“It does smell funny,” agreed Bob. “And did
you see who that was?”</p>

<p>“Our peppery friend, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>,” remarked
Jerry. “He evidently didn’t want to meet us, for
he turned away like a shot.”</p>

<p>“He had something under his arm,” went on
Ned. “Fellows, I don’t want to be an alarmist,
but after all that has passed, and smelling what I
believe to be powder smoke, don’t you think we
ought to tell the captain?”</p>

<p>“And get laughed at?” asked Jerry. “Not
much. We got ourselves into a conspicuous position
once by having something to do with this man,
and I’m not going to risk it again. He, too, seems
to have had enough of us, for it was evident that
he didn’t want to meet us. Let well enough alone,
I say.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” insisted Ned, “but suppose he’s been
up to some trick here? Suppose he may have
planted——”</p>

<p>Ned did not finish what he had started to say.
For at that moment there was a commotion in that
part of the ship given over to hospital needs, and
loud cries indicated that something unusual was
going on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Bob, looking at his two
chums.</p>

<p>“Sounds as if some of the patients were making
a row,” remarked Jerry. “It may be Meldon, the
fellow who attacked you in a nightmare, Bob.
Perhaps he’s having another spasm, poor fellow.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better go back there and see if we
can give any help,” suggested Ned. “Sometimes
when they get to raving that way, as they often
do, they’re stronger than usual and the women
nurses can’t handle ’em. Let’s go and see if we
can help.”</p>

<p>“It may be a good idea,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>Forgetting, or putting aside, rather, for the
time being, the memory of the strange man they
had met, and the odd manner in which he had
acted, the three chums turned back to the hospital
which they had just left.</p>

<p>And it was fortunate that they did. For two
of the wounded men had become delirious and
were fighting their nurses. And as it happened,
there was only one doctor on duty just then, and
he was having his hands full.</p>

<p>Of course the two patients did not know what
they were doing, their pain and suffering having affected
their brains temporarily, and the aid of
Ned, Bob and Jerry in subduing them was greatly
appreciated by the nurses. In fact, the help was
absolutely necessary, for one of the nurses was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
danger of bodily harm from the unreasoning
strength of the patient, a big raw-boned Kentucky
mountaineer, who had been sorely wounded in the
head, and who was scarcely on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>But, being directed by the nurses and by the one
doctor, the Motor Boys soon managed to subdue
without the use of undue force the two half-insane
patients, who were soon strapped to their
cots.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, boys!” exclaimed the
head surgeon, when he had come in and had been
told of what had happened. “You helped out a
whole lot. I shall see that you are officially
thanked.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this wasn’t anything,” declared Jerry.
“We just heard the row and came to do what we
could.”</p>

<p>“Well, I, for one, am mighty glad of it,” exclaimed
the panting nurse, who had been in danger
from the attack of the crazed soldier. “I
shall never forget it! I went through a good part
of the war, and I didn’t want to have to wear a
wound stripe on the way home,” and she nodded
to the three chums.</p>

<p>“This bids fair to be an eventful voyage,” remarked
Jerry, when he and his friends were up
on the main deck again. “We started off with a
bad omen—putting back to port; Bob has to fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
for his life; and now we rescue some of the nurses.
I wonder what’s next on the program?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we’d better report what we
saw down in the passage?” asked Ned, “and that
we smelled what might have been a burning fuse?”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s first think it over a bit,” suggested
Jerry. “I’d hate, like all get-out, to give a false
alarm. Suppose we go to the ship captain, or our
captain, which would be the proper procedure,
and tell him what we saw? What evidence have
we?”</p>

<p>“Well, we saw that pepper-hash individual with
something black under his arm,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“Might have been a box of cigarettes he was
taking to some of the wounded men,” interposed
Jerry.</p>

<p>“He ran back when he saw us,” persisted Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, because of the encounter we had before,”
agreed Jerry. “That doesn’t prove anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure I smelled powder smoke—the
same as when a bomb fuse is lighted,” declared
Ned.</p>

<p>“You may have, and, again, you may have
merely got a whiff of a bad, cheap cigar. That’s
no evidence, so far. If we went to the captain
with that information he’d only laugh at us.</p>

<p>“Besides,” went on Jerry, “you’ve got to have
motives for suspecting any one, even <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
And you can be pretty sure he didn’t get on board
this troopship unless he was well vouched for.
They aren’t taking any chances.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I’m imagining a whole lot,” admitted
Ned. “Only I would like to know who
that fellow is, what his game is, and why he seems
to have such a grudge against our Professor Snodgrass.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d like the answer to those questions
myself,” admitted Jerry. “But to get at them I
don’t just feel like going to the <i>Sherman’s</i> captain
and telling him we suspect the pepper-pot of being
a German spy.”</p>

<p>“No,” assented Ned slowly, “I don’t suppose
we can do that. But I’m going to keep my eyes
open.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t a sign of anything wrong when
we came back through the passage where we met
that duck,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“No. But it still smelled mighty queer,” stated
Ned.</p>

<p>“It always will so near the hospital rooms,”
suggested Jerry. “The odor of iodoform is very
lingering.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it was that,” agreed Ned. “But
I’m going to keep my eyes open.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we can all do that,” came from Jerry.
“And now let’s get in line for the semi-occasional
feed. It’s about due, I think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re falling in with me, I see,” laughed Bob.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the three chums moved
about on board the <i>Sherman</i> as much as the
crowded condition of the transport would permit.
And it was while making their way about the
crowded boat deck that they heard some one hail
them with:</p>

<p>“Well, if there aren’t the three musketeers!”</p>

<p>Turning quickly, Ned, Bob, and Jerry beheld a
youth whom they had learned to know and like
in the trenches.</p>

<p>“Well, if it isn’t old Hen Wilson!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Old scout Hen!” added Ned.</p>

<p>“Where’d you blow in from?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Been here all the while,” was the answer, as
the four met in a jolly circle. “That’s what I was
just going to ask you. I didn’t know you were
on board.”</p>

<p>“Nor we you,” declared Jerry. “There’s such
a bunch on this craft that we may meet a lot more
friends we knew in the fighting days. Where have
you been keeping yourself, Hen?”</p>

<p>“Oh, moving around here and there. I ran into
a bunch of the old gang that helped clean up that
machine-gun nest—you know, Jerry—the place
where you got whiffed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember that all right. And so some
of those fellows are on board? Lead me to ’em!”</p>

<p>The rest of the day was most pleasantly spent—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
is, as pleasantly as possible under the circumstances—and
Ned, Bob, and Jerry were glad
that they had found old friends whose presence
would help while away what might, otherwise, be
a tedious voyage.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of the night that Jerry was
awakened by a dull explosion and a concussion that
sent a tremor through the whole ship. Dim lights
that were burning near the sleeping quarters went
out suddenly, and Jerry, straining his eyes to
pierce the darkness and at the same time sitting
up and feeling about him, heard the voice of Ned
crying:</p>

<p>“What is it? What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>At the same moment Bob broke in with:</p>

<p>“We hit something sure, that time, or something
hit us! If the whole bottom isn’t blown out
of the ship we’re lucky!”</p>

<p>And then followed a scene of confusion and almost
panic.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>DISABLED</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Sudden noises at night, particularly when accompanied
by a tremor and by vibrations that
shake one to his innermost being, are, in themselves,
terrifying. When to that is added the additional
source of danger of the occurrence taking
place at sea on board a crowded transport and
the possibilities for tragic happenings from this
source, fears may well be multiplied.</p>

<p>And yet, such was the discipline and foresightedness
on board the <i>Sherman</i> that the panic and
terror were only momentary. No sooner did Ned,
Bob, and Jerry, together with many of their comrades,
find themselves stumbling about in the dark
with the noise of the explosion still ringing in their
ears, than they were aware of signals being
sounded throughout the ship.</p>

<p>The signals were those for instant falling in
on the part of the soldiers, and indicated that they
were to take the quarters assigned to them, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
man nearest the boat in which he was to have a
place should destruction menace the ship.</p>

<p>And then, while excited cries were issuing from
many throats and when some, in the confusion,
forgot what the bugle calls meant and while still
others were instinctively terrified in the darkness,
lights began to gleam. Some of the illumination
came from oil lanterns provided for an emergency
to the dynamo lighting system of the ship. Other
glows flitted from portable electric flash-torches
that many of the officers and men carried, but the
greater light came from the auxiliary storage battery
system, which was switched on as soon as the
proper officer found that the big, whirring dynamo
was out of commission.</p>

<p>“Fall in! Fall in! Take your places at the
boats!” cried the officers, rapidly getting the situation
well in hand. “Be ready for the order to
abandon ship!”</p>

<p>And then perfect order came out of confusion.
No longer did the soldiers rush madly about, crying
out to know what had happened. No longer
was the pall of blackness hiding man from the
sight of man. Once more wonderful discipline was
uppermost.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about?” asked Bob of Ned, as
he and his chum followed Jerry to their appointed
station.</p>

<p>“Your guess is as good as the next man’s,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Jerry. “Let’s get to our boat first, and talk afterward.”</p>

<p>They stumbled upward and onward in the midst
of the crowd, groping their way, for the lighting
system, though sufficiently good to enable them to
see to progress, was not as bright as the regular
one. As they stumbled on toward their boat-station
a voice of authority cried:</p>

<p>“Wounded men first in the boats!”</p>

<p>“Right!” sang out a number of hearty voices,
and it was evident there would be no terrible
scenes should it become necessary to abandon
ship. And this dire thought was uppermost in the
minds of all.</p>

<p>It was also evident that the <i>Sherman</i> had received
an injury much more serious than the previous
one that had sent her back to the dock for
repairs to the machinery which had been so quickly
made. She had come to a stop now in the darkness
on the broad ocean, and was slowly heaving
to the swell. There was also a slight list to one
side, its cause unknown to the soldiers who, in
response to the commands of their officers, were
moving in orderly array to safety stations.</p>

<p>“Well, our adventures are keeping up,” said
Jerry in a low voice to his two chums when they
had reached their boat station and stood waiting
for further orders. “But I didn’t quite bargain
for this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Me, either,” commented Ned.</p>

<p>“Do you think the old boat will go down?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No telling,” Jerry answered. “It looks pretty
serious, or they wouldn’t get us all up here this
way. They’re bringing up the wounded now.”</p>

<p>As he spoke it could be seen that doctors, nurses,
and stretcher-bearers were appearing on deck with
the casualty cases. And to the credit of the unfortunate
ones be it said that they remained quiet,
and some even laughed and joked, though they
must have known, in case of the necessity for abandoning
ship and taking to the small boats, that
their chances of being saved were infinitely smaller
than those of able-bodied men. But they were
Uncle Sam’s boys, and that is enough to say.</p>

<p>Naturally, on all sides, the questions asked
were:</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>“What caused it?”</p>

<p>“Did a sub attack us?”</p>

<p>And so insistent were these queries, and so vital
was it to have some information given out, that
when at last all the wounded had been brought
up and every man was at his station the officer
commanding the troops addressed them.</p>

<p>“As you all know, there has been an unfortunate
accident,” he said. “The full extent is not
yet known, but I am authorized by Captain Munson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to say that the ship is in no immediate danger.
We are protected by a number of water-tight bulkheads,
and, so far, only one compartment is
flooded. This has been closed off and we expect
to keep on.”</p>

<p>A cheer greeted this announcement. Holding
up his hand for silence, the colonel, standing in the
light of a ship lantern, went on:</p>

<p>“As you have heard ordered, the wounded will
be first placed in the boats in case we have to
abandon ship. Others will follow as directed. It
is of prime necessity that every man obey implicitly
his superior officers. The first to disobey
will be instantly shot! You know what that
means!” and his voice itself was like the click of
a gun.</p>

<p>“It may be that we shall not have to take to
the boats,” the colonel resumed. “An investigation
of the damage done is now being made. As
far as can be learned it was caused by an explosion
of one of the small boilers. What caused the
boiler to explode we do not yet know. But for
the present every one must stand at attention and
be ready for quick disembarkation.</p>

<p>“There have been men injured in the engine
room, and they will take their places with our
wounded in the boats first!” the colonel added,
and his words were greeted with a cheer, which
told him and the other officers that there would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
be no disgraceful scenes at the end in case the end
should be a tragic one.</p>

<p>“Now you know as much as I do,” the colonel
concluded. “We may be only slightly damaged,
and we may be greatly so. We shall know in a
little while. In the meantime, stand by!”</p>

<p>Another cheer punctuated the closing remarks,
and then followed a nerve-racking time. There
was nothing to be done except to wait for the
conclusion of the investigation of the ship’s officers.
They were below now, seeking to learn
how badly damaged were the craft’s vitals.</p>

<p>“Well, this is worse and more of it,” remarked
Bob, as he began to feel about him to ascertain
if he had as many of his possessions as he had
been able to gather up in the haste.</p>

<p>“It may not be so bad,” declared Jerry. “We
aren’t a great way from the coast, for we haven’t
made any wonderful speed so far. I believe we
can get back.”</p>

<p>“What! In the small boats?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Maybe. Or the <i>Sherman</i> may limp back under
her own steam.”</p>

<p>“Not the way she’s listing now,” declared Ned.
“Say!” he went on earnestly, “I wish we’d told
some one about seeing that peppery chap with the
black box leaving a trail of a fuse smell behind
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t get to imagining things!” cautioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Jerry. “There are enough real happenings as it
is. Stand by—that’s the order!”</p>

<p>“But we might have prevented this,” Ned persisted.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” declared his tall chum. “This
was an engine-room accident. Probably they
were carrying too much steam. Lucky it wasn’t
any worse.”</p>

<p>“We don’t know how bad it is,” remarked Bob.
“Seems to me the lights are getting dimmer;
aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re shutting some off to save the
current,” replied Jerry. “They switched on the
storage battery, I heard some one say. They are
getting dimmer, that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>As he spoke the incandescent lights began
gradually fading away. The filaments, from a
white-hot glow, turned red, and then went out, as
a glowing match slowly loses its illumination. All
that lighted the scenes on the ship’s decks now
were the emergency oil lanterns and an occasional
pocket electric torch.</p>

<p>“Let no one be alarmed!” called the colonel.
“The lights are being turned off to save the battery
current for the wireless in case we have to
call for assistance. It will soon be morning.”</p>

<p>“If they have to depend for wireless calls on a
storage battery it won’t last very long,” declared
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s wait and see,” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>They all stood waiting for the result of the
investigation of the damage done to the troopship.
And as they waited in the semi-darkness
many thoughts came to each man. It was a time
to try one’s soul.</p>

<p>Finally there was a commotion near a group
of officers, which included the commanding colonel
of the troops on the <i>Sherman</i>. The ship’s captain
was seen speaking to the colonel by Ned, Bob,
and Jerry. And so close were the lads to the
scene of the consultation that they overheard
something of what was said.</p>

<p>One word, among the others, seemed to stand
out as if written in letters of fire. And that one
word was:</p>

<p>“Disabled!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>THE MYSTERIOUS CABIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ned nudged his two chums as they stood in the
now almost complete darkness, waiting near their
boat station for what was next to happen.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” asked Ned Slade in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“I did,” answered Jerry. “Don’t repeat it.”</p>

<p>“But, if we’re disabled,” whispered Bob,
“doesn’t that mean we’ll sink sooner or later?
And I haven’t noticed any other ships near us—not
since we started the second time.”</p>

<p>“Disabled doesn’t mean that we’re sinking,”
said Jerry, “and there’s no use starting another
near-panic by scattering that word broadcast. If
we’re disabled it may only mean that we can’t proceed
under our own steam.”</p>

<p>“How else are we going to proceed?” demanded
Ned.</p>

<p>“Send out a wireless call for help and be towed
back to port,” was Jerry’s answer. “That’s easy.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of that,” murmured Ned. “But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
say, isn’t it bad luck to have to go back to port
twice on the same voyage?”</p>

<p>“Not half as bad luck as it would be to go once
to Davy Jones’s locker!” declared Jerry, with a
trace of mirth—just a faint trace, for the situation
was still too tense to admit of any great feeling
of jollity.</p>

<p>“Well, of course there’s something in that,”
admitted Ned.</p>

<p>“A whole lot in it!” came from Bob. “Say,
have you fellows got anything to eat?” he demanded,
still speaking in a whisper, for the word
of “silence in the ranks” had gone forth.</p>

<p>“Eat!” exclaimed Jerry in tense tones. “What
do you think we are, anyhow? Walking cupboards?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know but what you might have stowed
away a cake or two of chocolate apiece,” sighed
Bob. “Lots of times they forget to provision the
boats when they abandon ship in a hurry. Chocolate
is nourishing. I’ve got three big cakes. That’s
one each. Here,” and he extended one to Ned
and another to Jerry.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea?” demanded the tall lad,
with amused curiosity.</p>

<p>“We might get separated,” answered Bob.
“Better take this when you can get it. That cake
of chocolate will keep you alive several days.”</p>

<p>“He’s got it all figured out,” said Ned. “Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
you aren’t so bad at that, Chunky. It may come
in handy!” and he put his cake away.</p>

<p>Jerry did likewise, and then they stood waiting
for the next development. It was not long in
coming.</p>

<p>Following the conference of the colonel and
his army officers with the captain of the <i>Sherman</i>
there was a tense period for a little while, until
the colonel made another announcement.</p>

<p>“I regret to inform you, men,” he said, “that
the accident in the engine room is more serious
than at first was thought. The transport is disabled,
and will not be able to proceed under her
own power—at least, not until extensive repairs
are made. An effort will be made to have the
engines patched up, but this may not be possible.</p>

<p>“In the latter case we shall have to be towed
back to France. I know that seems hard,” he
said quickly; “but it is better than sinking in mid-ocean,
and that possibility confronted us all for
a time.</p>

<p>“Now we shall all be saved, but it may take
some little time. The ship’s captain will at once
order wireless calls for assistance to be sent out,
and we should have an answer within a short time.
Then, in another day, or, at most, two, we should
receive help. So make the best of a bad situation.
You will presently be ordered back to your sleeping
quarters, for there is no danger of the ship’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
sinking. She will float for years in this condition.
Only one compartment is flooded, and that has
been shut off from the rest of the craft.</p>

<p>“The wounded will first be carried back to the
hospital quarters, and then the others may go back
to bed. I regret this occurrence, but you, who
have fought in the Great War, will recognize
this as only a minor happening compared to
others.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for the colonel!” called some
one, and right heartily they came.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Captain Munson!” some one
else demanded, and the tribute to the commander
of the disabled vessel was no less genuine.</p>

<p>The taking back of the wounded who had been
brought up on the boat deck to be ready for quick
transfer to the small craft went on in orderly
fashion, though not so quickly as they had been
brought from the hospital. The same need of
speed was not present.</p>

<p>Then Ned, Bob, Jerry and the others were allowed
to go back to where they had been sleeping,
or trying to. And once more peace and quiet
seemed to settle down over the ship. The list had
been corrected somewhat, though in what manner
the three friends did not know, and the <i>Sherman</i>
was now riding more easily, though she was still
without forward motion, save that perhaps imparted
to her by the wind or the ocean currents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you think we’d better tell what we know
about old pepper-pot?” asked Ned of his chums,
as they reached their sleeping quarters.</p>

<p>“I suppose, after what has happened, that it
will be best to,” assented Jerry. “Mind you, I’m
not saying he had anything to do with the explosion
of the boiler. But later on, if anything should
come up, I suppose we’d feel better to remember
that we had told. We’ll go to the captain in the
morning.”</p>

<p>The boys were just composing themselves for
some hours of rest in what remained of the night
when they heard the crackle of the wireless overhead.</p>

<p>“Well, anything new?” asked Bob the next
morning, as he made about the only kind of toilet
possible on the crowded transport.</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear any,” responded Jerry. “Let’s
get some eats, and then we’ll report to our captain
what we know and let him do as he thinks
best.”</p>

<p>On their way to receive from the galley their
usual daily ration, Ned seemed to be listening
intently for something.</p>

<p>“Want to hear another explosion?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, I was listening for the crackle of the
wireless. I don’t hear it; do you?”</p>

<p>“That’s so—it is silent,” commented Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, well, maybe they’ve sent off a message
for help, have received an answer, and now there’s
nothing to do but wait,” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Ned. But his chums observed
that he was deeply silent during mess.
And as soon as it was over he suggested that they
go up on deck.</p>

<p>“Better look for our captain first,” suggested
Jerry. “His quarters are aft.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see him all right,” Ned declared. “I
want to find out about something else, first.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“The wireless,” answered Ned. “I want to see
if we’ve had any answer to our calls for help.”</p>

<p>As they approached the vicinity of the wireless
room, the boys, and many others, became aware
that something unusual had taken place. There
was a group of officers—both those of the ship
and those in command of the returning soldiers—gathered
about the electrical cabin, and workmen
were hurrying to and fro.</p>

<p>“What’s up, buddy?” asked Ned of a fellow
soldier.</p>

<p>“Don’t know, exactly,” was the answer. “But
I think the wireless has given out.”</p>

<p>“Before we got off any messages asking for
help?” demanded Ned.</p>

<p>“So they say. But I’m not sure. Here comes
my sergeant. I’ll ask.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>There was an exchange of confidences, and
then the Motor Boys heard more bad news.</p>

<p>“I thought so!” exclaimed Ned, as he turned
away from where he had been questioning the
two soldiers.</p>

<p>“Thought what?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“That the wireless had given out! That’s
what happened. The storage battery short-circuited,
the auxiliary dynamo burned out, and they
can’t get off a single message.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they had already sent out an S. O. S.
call,” suggested Jerry, hoping to the last.</p>

<p>“They started one, the sergeant says,” replied
Ned, “but the apparatus went fluey before they
could give our position.”</p>

<p>“Gee! that’s tough luck!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, it might be worse!” declared Jerry, with
a hopefulness he did not altogether feel. “They
got off a message asking for help, and even though
our position wasn’t given, it can be pretty well
guessed. They know which way we started, and
about how fast we have steamed. They can send
some one out to pick us up.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Ned gloomily. “Well, there’s
no use worrying over it. We’re still afloat, and
that’s something. Now then, let’s go to see our
captain, or the first lieutenant. We’ll report on
pepper-pot. It may be nothing, and, again, it may
be something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>They started to find their own special company
officers, and while they were inquiring they stood
near a cabin that was among a number of others
given over to officers.</p>

<p>Ned had just asked as to the probable whereabouts
of his captain and a lieutenant was in the
act of replying when two marines, with rifles and
fixed bayonets, came swinging along the passage.
They halted in front of the cabin, before which
stood the lieutenant, and after their salute had
been returned, the officer said:</p>

<p>“You are to remain on guard here in front of
this cabin until relieved. Let no one go in or come
out without written authority from Captain Munson.
Remember—written authority!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” answered the marines, and then the
lieutenant turned to speak to the three friends
while they, in turn, gazed at the closed door of
the mysterious cabin.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>CALLING IN VAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Did you wish to see me?” the lieutenant
asked, as Jerry and his chums looked in rather a
fixed manner at the young man.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the tall lad. “We wish to
find out where Captain Ware may be found.
We’re in his company, and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. You were asking me that when I
had to give instructions to these sentinels. If
you’ll come with me I’ll take you to Captain
Ware.”</p>

<p>He turned to go, but, before leaving, he looked
again at the marine corps sentinels, one of whom
stood on either side of the closed door of the
mysterious cabin—at least it was mysterious to
the three Motor Boys.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget!” the lieutenant cautioned. “No
one is to enter that cabin—not even I—without a
written order from Captain Munson.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was the answer in chorus, and, acknowledging
the salutes of the sentries, the lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
strode away, followed by Ned, Bob, and
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Has there been a mutiny, sir, or anything like
that?” asked Ned of the lieutenant, at the same
time nudging his two comrades to indicate that he
was taking a chance in thus putting a question to
a superior officer on a subject that might well be
a forbidden one.</p>

<p>“A mutiny? What makes you think that?” was
the quick retort.</p>

<p>“Oh, on account of what happened—the blowing
up of the boiler, and all that. I thought maybe
some one had been found planting a bomb in the
engine room, sir, and——”</p>

<p>“You must have been doing quite a bit of thinking,”
was the smiling comment of the young officer.
“Be careful you don’t do too much. Or, at
least, if you do, keep your thoughts to yourself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” assented Ned, and he knew then that
his questions were not to be answered.</p>

<p>“Who told you the boiler had been blown up,
and what made you think a bomb had been placed
in the engine room?” asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Oh, we just imagined so, that’s all, sir,” Ned
replied.</p>

<p>“It sounded like an explosion, sir,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, it was,” and the lieutenant’s answer was
a bit snappy. “One of the boilers blew out a main
feed steam pipe. It takes an explosion to do that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
or rather, the act is explosive in itself. But that
doesn’t say it was a bomb.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad it wasn’t,” commented Bob.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say it wasn’t!” came quickly from the
young officer. “All I said was that a steam boiler
could blow up without a bomb having caused it.
I don’t know that any one knows exactly what
caused the accident to the ship. We are still investigating,
and the less talk about it the better—especially
when no facts are known. So I advise
you young gentlemen not to do too much talking.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” murmured Ned. “But we were
just thinking—about that cabin, you know—we
were just thinking——”</p>

<p>“But keep your thoughts to yourselves—for the
time being,” interrupted the lieutenant. “You
may hear all about it later, and again you may
not.”</p>

<p>They found Captain Ware in a small cabin
which he had to share with fellow officers, so
crowded were accommodations aboard the <i>Sherman</i>.
The captain greeted the boys cordially.</p>

<p>“Now don’t tell me,” he began with a smile,
“that you have come to complain of the sleeping
quarters, the food, or the lack of exercise. I know
all that already—a dozen times over,” and he motioned
to a pile of papers on his bed.</p>

<p>“Oh, we haven’t come to complain, sir,” voiced
Ned. “But we have something we’d like to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
you, and it may have to do with the accident that
disabled the ship.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s interesting, to say the least,” commented
the captain. “Come in, boys. There isn’t
a great deal of room, but if you stand up while
you’re talking I guess we can squeeze you all in.
These cabins were made for only two.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the trio entered and, after a few
false starts and a friendly rivalry as to who should
open the narrative, the story was finally told. It
began with the encounter in the Brest restaurant,
when Jerry mistook a stranger for Professor Snodgrass
with the consequent unreasonable indignation
on the part of the little bald-headed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cochon</i>,
as he had been dubbed.</p>

<p>Then the boys told of having met the man in
the passageway, and of how he turned back at the
sight of them, evidently trying to conceal a black
object he carried.</p>

<p>Ned told of having smelled what seemed to be
a burning fuse; and from there the tale went on
to the guarded cabin.</p>

<p>“Hum,” mused Captain Ware, when the boys
had finished. “Is that all?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Ned, who had assumed the
role of spokesman. “Except that we thought we
ought to report it all to you, sir, so you could tell
Captain Munson if you thought best to do so.”</p>

<p>“You have done quite right. And, now that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
you have reported to me, please don’t say anything
about it to any one else.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there may be anything in it,
sir?” asked Bob, who could not refrain from his
impulsive question. “I mean do you think this
little man, who looks like our Professor Snodgrass
from the back, could have tried to blow up the
ship?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he could do it easily enough, if he
was so minded and had the opportunity,” answered
the captain. “But, mind you, I am not
saying that he did. This must be investigated, and
Captain Munson, in connection with our army officers,
will be the one to do this. I am glad you
told me what you did. Now don’t talk about it
any more. There is no use in starting rumors,
the effect of which we can tell nothing about.
And, too, it may prove to be a false alarm.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we were afraid of,” said Jerry.
“We didn’t want to get in wrong. But we thought
it best to speak after we saw the marines put on
duty at the cabin, for we thought it might be of
more importance than it seemed in the beginning.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the captain, noncommittally.
“Well, I’ll let you know when your further testimony
is needed. Now don’t forget to keep still
about this.”</p>

<p>He dismissed them with a smile, and the boys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
feeling they had done all in their power to set
things right and to prevent any further outrages,
in case it really should turn out that an attempt
had been made to blow up the ship, went up on
deck.</p>

<p>“I’m glad that’s off my mind,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“So’m I,” added Bob. “There must be something
in it all right, or they wouldn’t be guarding
that cabin.”</p>

<p>“It’s queer, to say the least,” admitted Jerry.
“If we could only know——”</p>

<p>“Hark! What’s that?” interrupted Ned, as
they neared the head of the companionway.</p>

<p>“The wireless!” cried Bob. “It’s working
again!”</p>

<p>And to the ears of the boys came the well-known
crackle that told of electrical impulses
being sent off into space.</p>

<p>Quickly the three chums looked about them
when they reached the deck. A group around the
wireless room testified that in some manner the
disabled machinery had been put in operation
again.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Ned was told by a comrade to whom he
put an inquiry, “they managed to fix up a small
dynamo, and they’re sending out calls for help.”</p>

<p>“Then we’re all right!” decided Bob. “I guess
my appetite will come back now.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t know you’d lost it!” mocked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t feel a bit like eating!” retorted
the stout lad.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the first time such a thing has happened
in a good many years,” commented Jerry.</p>

<p>With every one else on board, they were vitally
interested in the reëstablishment of the wireless.
But as the day went on and no replies came to
call after call that was flashed into the void, the
feeling of hope gave way to one of despair.</p>

<p>“Don’t they answer?” was the question asked
over and over again.</p>

<p>“No reply,” was the report of the wireless men,
as they bent over their keys and strained their ears
to catch the faintest click that might come through
the ear-pieces strapped to their heads. All their
flashing calls seemed in vain.</p>

<small>DRIFTING</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There is, perhaps, no greater strain to be endured
than waiting—waiting for some certain
time to come, waiting for an event to pass, waiting
for a letter or a message. And when this
nervous strain is multiplied several thousand
times, and when the waiting has to do with perhaps
the very continuation of life itself, it becomes
at last almost unendurable.</p>

<p>That is what Ned, Bob, and Jerry, and their
thousands of comrades on board the <i>Sherman</i>,
found as they waited for some reply to come to
the wireless calls. As has been related, the dynamo
that sent out the impulses, controlled by the
operators’ keys, had been patched up so that it
revolved. Steam was generated for a small engine.</p>

<p>“But how long she’ll work no one knows,” confided
an operator to Jerry, coming off duty after
several anxious hours in the little deck house.
“The repairs are only temporary, the engineer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
tells me, and she may break down again any
minute.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll keep on sending out calls as long
as you can, won’t you?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“How do you account for not getting replies to
the wireless calls? You’re sending them out
broadcast, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“That’s it. They can be picked up by any
number of shore stations, to say nothing of ships
at sea.”</p>

<p>“Then why aren’t our calls picked up and answered?”
Bob queried.</p>

<p>“Well, there are two reasons that may possibly
explain it,” answered the operator. “One is that
we’re having a great deal of trouble with static.
That’s the electricity that’s always more or less in
the air, you know. It interferes with our wireless
waves.”</p>

<p>“I thought some fellow got up a patent apparatus
to overcome that trouble,” ventured Ned.</p>

<p>“He claimed to,” answered the operator; “but
I haven’t yet seen any device that will turn the
trick. And believe me, when Old Man Static gets
in his fine work you might as well close your
switch, take off your headpiece, and read a book.
When the static gets ready to quiet down and stop
cutting up high jinks it’ll do it, and not before.</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t mean to say,” he went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
“that it’s as bad as when wireless was first invented.
A good deal of the trouble has been
overcome. But to-day it’s very bad.</p>

<p>“Then, too, our apparatus isn’t working right.
She got a jolt when that midnight explosion took
place, and the operator who was on duty then
slammed in a high-powered current and burned
out some of the fuses. Since then it’s been on the
floo, and, though we’ve been pounding the keys
for all we’re worth, we don’t know whether our
messages are getting anywhere or not. Evidently
they aren’t, for we haven’t had any replies, and
in the natural course of things we would, as we
ought to be in the track of many ships going and
coming.”</p>

<p>“Just how far do you think the wireless message
calls you’ve sent out have gone?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Hard to tell,” was the answer. “They may
shoot off for a thousand miles—our range is fully
that when the machinery is in good condition—and
again they may not get a mile away from the
ship. I’m inclined to think, though, that the messages
leave here all right, but are all balled up by
static, or else by other messages jamming them,
after they get up in the air.</p>

<p>“You know,” the operator went on, “we work
according to different wave lengths. That is, the
electrical impulses we send out are so many meters
in length. Now then, if we send out messages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
one certain wave length, and some other ship,
within the prescribed distance, sends out messages
at the same time, tuned as ours are, but of a more
powerful wave length, ours get all jammed to
pieces, so to speak. And all the receiver hears
is a jumble of dots and dashes in his earpiece.
Naturally he tunes out of that clashing, and listens
to what he can hear; to wave lengths that are just
right.”</p>

<p>“So, as far as you can tell,” observed Jerry,
“it’s just as if a man wrote a lot of telegrams,
asking for help, and then, somehow, they got
tossed into the waste-paper basket before any one
who could give the help read them, is it?”</p>

<p>“That’s one way of putting it,” conceded the
operator. “But there is one hope.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“The static disturbance may clear off at any
time, or some fellow listening in may catch our
call and then send it to the proper place. If that’s
done, help will be rushed to us. But I must admit
there’s no telling when this will happen.”</p>

<p>“What can we do if we don’t get any reply?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to drift on until they can
patch up the machinery, I suppose,” the operator
replied.</p>

<p>“Can they do that?” Ned questioned.</p>

<p>“I believe they’re going to try,” was the answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
“Anything is better than just drifting
around.”</p>

<p>“And yet some ship may sight us at any time,”
ventured Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true,” was the tired wireless man’s
remark. “I’ve been torpedoed twice, and I know
what it means to be drifting about waiting for
the chance of being picked up. I had hoped I
shouldn’t have to go through with it again, but
it seems I may have to. Well, the boys are going
to keep on trying, and I’ll do my share when I go
on duty again.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind the sending off of messages so
much,” he concluded, as he continued on his way
to the cabin set apart for the use of himself and
his companions. “It’s the strain of listening for
a reply that gets on my nerves. You hear a click
in the earpiece, and you think surely it’s coming.
Then it turns out to be just Old Man Static getting
in his fine work, or else a jumble of dots and
dashes from no one knows where—out of the sky,
you might say—and there you are. Four hours
of that are enough to wear any one’s nerves to a
thread.”</p>

<p>“You said it!” commented Jerry. “Well, good
luck to you!”</p>

<p>Interest in the reëstablishment of the wireless
apparatus, even though it was only temporarily
repaired, and anxiety to know when some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
messages sent off into space would be answered
kept every one on board the <i>Sherman</i> keyed up to
the highest pitch. They were all under a heavy
strain.</p>

<p>But as hour after hour passed, and no good
news came, faces that had taken on looks of hope
began to lose them. The time came for the man
who had talked to the Motor Boys to go back on
duty.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s for another try,” he said, with a
weary smile, as he entered the cabin.</p>

<p>Having nothing better to do, Ned, Bob, and
Jerry remained as close as possible to the wireless
room. They wanted to know, as soon as might
be, if any help was on the way.</p>

<p>It was about an hour after George Hardy, the
wireless man who had talked to the three friends,
had gone on duty for his second shift since the
repair of the apparatus, that he came out of the
wireless room with a despairing look on his face.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry quickly.</p>

<p>“It’s all up!” was the answer.</p>

<p>“All up! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Apparatus all burned out,” Hardy went on.
“We tried to the limit of the power, and the whole
business has gone bluey. Can’t get another spark
out of her.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Ned, and the faces of Bob
and Jerry, as well as those of others who heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the bad news, took on an added look of care and
anxiety.</p>

<p>“But you can still listen in, can’t you?” asked
Ned, after a pause. “Is the receiving apparatus
damaged?”</p>

<p>“No, that’s still in good shape,” Hardy answered.
“If, by any chance, some of our messages
reached some station, and they can tell where
to reply to us, and how, we may get an answer.
We’re going to listen in from now on.”</p>

<p>“Well, let us hope that you hear something,”
murmured Jerry.</p>

<p>“And all we can do is drift on,” said Ned
drearily.</p>

<p>The day passed without anything happening.
So many thoughts occupied the minds of the three
Cresville boys that they almost forgot to speculate
on the outcome of the information they had
given their captain. They did not cease to wonder
at times, though, as to who occupied the mysteriously
guarded cabin, and they also tried to
guess the reason for the peculiar actions of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
cochon</i>.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s locked up there as a bomb-planter,”
suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s possible,” assented Ned.</p>

<p>“I wish Professor Snodgrass were here,” Bob
went on.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Jerry. “Do you think he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
fix up the wireless, mend the broken boiler, or
help us in any way?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” was the answer from the stout
youth. “But he’s better fun than just standing
about, waiting for something to happen.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d like to see him, too,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>The night passed without incident, save that
word went about the ship now and then that the
engine-room force was working desperately to
make repairs which would enable the transport to
proceed, however lamely.</p>

<p>But when the sun rose, a red ball of fire in the
morning, it saw the <i>Sherman</i> still drifting.</p>

<p>“We’re in for some change of weather,” remarked
a sailor in the hearing of the chums.</p>

<p>“A storm?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Can’t say, but looks like it.”</p>

<p>And the disabled troopship kept on drifting—drifting—drifting.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Weary were the hours, even fraught with anxiety
as they were, that Ned, Bob, and Jerry passed
aboard the drifting craft. Notwithstanding the
presence of many of their comrades in arms, there
was a sense of loneliness on the vast expanse of
the waters of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Had the <i>Sherman</i> been proceeding along under
her own power, lessening each hour the miles that
separated her from the shores of America, this
feeling would not have manifested itself. But as
it was, with every one ready for the trip home,
which, for this unavoidable cause, could not be
completed, the sense of the vastness and loneliness
of the ocean, on which the troopship could
only drift, filled the boys’ hearts.</p>

<p>With the acknowledgment on the part of the
engineers that the wireless apparatus could no
longer issue appeals for help, all that remained
to be done in connection with that was to wait for
the possible chance that some of the messages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
previously sent out would be answered. To this
end one man was kept constantly on duty, with the
rubber receivers clamped to his ears. And from
the strained look on his face it was easy to guess
that his task, simple as it might seem, was no
sinecure.</p>

<p>“Why don’t they rig up some kind of sail?”
asked several of the soldiers who clustered on the
decks, a few forming a knot around Ned, Bob,
and Jerry, for those lads had let it be known that
they had been talking with one of the wireless
men, and, in a manner, spoke as those having
authority.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” chimed in another impatient one.
“If we can’t steam we ought to be able to sail.
I’ve often read stories of where a steamer lost a
propeller or something, and the sailors rigged up
a mast and got home all right.”</p>

<p>“They rigged up a jury mast—I’ve read about
that, too,” said another. “Why can’t we do that
here, and blow home?”</p>

<p>“Yes, why can’t we?” asked others. “Let’s
send a delegation to the captain and ask him!”</p>

<p>This seemed to find considerable favor, and it
might have been carried into effect but for the
fact that just then a peculiar tremor which could
mean but one thing was felt throughout the
ship.</p>

<p>“The engines have started!” cried Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the throb of the propeller, sure
enough!” added Bob.</p>

<p>“We’re moving!” came from Jerry, and a
chorus of delighted cheers greeted this announcement.</p>

<p>There was no question as to the last statement.
The <i>Sherman</i> was, indeed, moving slowly through
the water. Very slowly, indeed. The motion was
hardly perceptible at first, but it was undoubted.
Soldier after soldier, hearing the news and feeling
the vibration, looked over the side and verified
Jerry’s announcement.</p>

<p>Like wild-fire rumors flew about the transport.
The chief one, and that most readily believed,
because it was the one that every one desired to
believe, was this:</p>

<p>“The engines have been repaired. Now we’ll
get home!”</p>

<p>And for a time this seemed true. The <i>Sherman</i>
gathered headway, and soon began moving
more swiftly. But, even at that, her speed was
nothing like what it had been at the beginning of
the voyage.</p>

<p>“I guess we had the wrong dope, Ned,” remarked
Jerry, as the three chums discussed the
situation. “It couldn’t have been a bomb explosion
after all, or they couldn’t have fixed up the
engines.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that I’ll go so far as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
admit that. There may have been a bomb explosion
all right, but, even then, they might have
been able to make repairs. Anyhow, we’re moving.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t heard anything about the information
we gave,” said Bob; “and the marines
are still on guard at that cabin—at least some
sentries are there. I passed the door a little
while ago.”</p>

<p>“And we haven’t had a sight of our pepper-pot
friend since that guard was stationed,” added
Ned. “I feel sure he’s in there, and that he tried
to blow up the ship.”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t make out very well, for we’re
on our way once more,” went on Bob. “And now
I feel like eating again! Come on, fellows, let’s
scout around and see if there’s a chance to get
some extra grub.”</p>

<p>Bob’s face, that had been gloomy all day (an
unusual thing for him) cleared now. He was
leading the way to the galley, followed by Ned and
Jerry, when the throbbing and vibration of the
craft, which unmistakably told of engines working,
suddenly ceased.</p>

<p>The three chums gazed blankly at one another,
and all about them other soldiers looked alarmed.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me she’s stopping again!” exclaimed
Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“She certainly has stopped, but she may start
up again,” voiced Jerry.</p>

<p>But as the minutes passed and the <i>Sherman</i> continued
to lose headway in the smooth sea, the
fears of the three chums and their companions became
confirmed.</p>

<p>A little later word was circulated about the ship
that the engines had broken down again. And
this time more completely than before. The temporary
repairs that had been made only caused a
worse break in the machinery when the second accident
happened.</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t a bomb explosion this time,”
said Jerry, when it was ascertained for certain that
the transport could not possibly proceed under her
own power.</p>

<p>“But that isn’t saying it wasn’t the original
cause of the accident,” declared Ned. “I’d like
to get hold of that pepper-pot and tell him what I
think of him.”</p>

<p>“They’ll do more than tell him, provided they
can prove that he had anything to do with it,”
commented Jerry.</p>

<p>“And it certainly looks as if he had—the way
they’re keeping him a prisoner in that cabin,” asserted
Ned.</p>

<p>“We aren’t sure he is there,” answered the tall
lad.</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure,” Ned asserted. “Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
there’s no hope for it. All we can do now is to
drift around, wait for a wireless message, or——”</p>

<p>“Sail home!” interrupted Bob. “Look, here
come some sailors now, getting ready to put up
some sort of sail.”</p>

<p>This, indeed, seemed to be the case. A number
of men came on deck, and then an effort began
to have sails take the place of steam power. There
were two masts on the craft, used, ordinarily, to
support the wireless apparatus. It was determined,
now, to fasten sails on these sticks of steel.</p>

<p>True not much speed could be hoped for, as
the <i>Sherman</i> was a big craft and powerful engines
were required to move her. But it was hoped that
such sails as could be rigged would at least give
her steerage way, and this would be needed, in
case of a storm, to keep her head on to the waves.
Though there was bitter disappointment over the
failure of the repairs to the engines, there was
hope in the sails.</p>

<p>So interested were the three chums in this that,
for the time, they forgot about the mysterious
cabin and its occupant, guarded by two marines.</p>

<p>Rumor had it that the engine room was a wreck,
but whether this was because of the explosion of
the steam pipe, which had caused injuries to a
number of men, or to the explosion of a bomb,
no one seemed to know for certain. All that was
sure was that the engines were out of commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>And if the tedious hours got on the nerves of
the soldiers who had their health and strength,
how much more so did they get on the nerves of
the wounded in the hospital wards? So over-wrought
were some of the casuals that it was
necessary to organize squads of the sound men
to visit in relays and cheer up their unfortunate
comrades.</p>

<p>This worked well, and it not only brightened
the wounded, but it gave the unoccupied well lads
a chance to do something to vary the monotony.</p>

<p>This, what might be termed a crisis, occurred
after it became known that the engines had broken
down for the second time. This news had brought
a reaction to the sick and wounded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the men were working hard to get
the sails rigged; but finally this was accomplished.
It was a makeshift, to be sure, but every one was
thankful even for that.</p>

<p>And then, as if Fate was determined to make a
plaything of the troopship and desired to show
what she could do when she tried, there came a
dead calm. There had been a fairly good wind
all the while the men were rigging the sails, and
it was thought, with the expanse of canvas spread
to the breeze, that progress could be made—perhaps
enough even to bring the ship back to port,
or at least in the path of some other craft.</p>

<p>But no sooner had the last rope been made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
fast and word given to bring the ship around, with
the wind as near astern as would serve the purpose,
than every breath of air died out.</p>

<p>“Dead calm!” muttered one of the sailors.
“Dead as a mackerel!”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s to be done?” asked Bob, when
it became evident that the transport could only
drift helplessly about.</p>

<p>“Whistle for a breeze!” some one suggested.</p>

<p>The idea was taken in good part, and it had
one effect—that of bringing forth a flood of—well,
not exactly melody, for too many were off-key.
But it brought forth laughs, and this was
something, considering the gloom that seemed
overpowering all on board.</p>

<p>All that could be done was to wait—wait for
the wind, wait for an answer on the wireless, wait
for the sight of some craft to aid them, either by
providing a tow or sending word of their plight
to those that could help.</p>

<p>Slowly the hours passed. Even the serving of
meals brought little relaxation or enjoyment, and
Ned and Jerry noticed, not without alarm, that
Bob’s appetite was very poor.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s start something!” proposed
Jerry, after a bit.</p>

<p>“Start what?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, a game, or something. We’ll go woozy
if we stand about waiting for something to happen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Let’s go below, get some of the fellows we
know, and see what we can dig up.”</p>

<p>As the three chums started for a companionway
they noticed an old sailor gazing out across the
ocean, which was as calm as the oft-spoken-of
“mill pond.”</p>

<p>“See anything?” asked Jerry, as he paused to
speak to the old salt.</p>

<p>“Not much,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“What’s the weather going to do?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Ha! I wish I knew!” was the retort.
“Looked like a storm this morning—red sun and
everything. Now I’ll be jiggered if I don’t think
we’re in for the doldrums!”</p>

<p>“What’s he saying?” asked another soldier lad
of Jerry. “Does he mean some disease may
break out?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the tall lad, with a smile.
“Doldrum means a calm—a dead calm. Ships
often run into the doldrums near the equator.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t mind what we ran into, if
we could only move,” was the dismal retort.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” voiced Ned. “The doldrums
are the worst calms ever—no motion at
all.”</p>

<p>“Good-night!” cried the seeker after information.</p>

<p>Passing through a corridor below decks on
their way to seek some of their friends to try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
organize something that would while away the
dreary monotony, the three chums approached a
closed cabin door.</p>

<p>And Bob remarked:</p>

<p>“Why, they’ve taken the marine guards away!
I wonder what that means?”</p>

<p>Before his companions could join in his speculation
the door of the cabin opened, and through
the opening the lads caught sight of a figure. It
was the figure of a little bald-headed man, and
he wore large spectacles. He was bending over
a mass of papers on a table in front of him, and,
at the sight of this individual, Ned, Bob, and
Jerry, as if in the same voice, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass!”</p>

<small>A WELL-KNOWN VOICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>In the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments is told
the story of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. In
this, at the mention of the magic word “Sesame,”
the ponderous rocky portal of the treasure cave
swung open or shut, according to its previous position.</p>

<p>And now, as Ned, Bob, and Jerry stood outside
the cabin door, through which they had a
glimpse of the well-remembered figure, and as
together they uttered the magic word “Professor
Snodgrass,” the same thing happened as happened
to Ali Baba.</p>

<p>The door of the cabin was quickly shut, and
not by the figure seated at the table before the
mass of papers.</p>

<p>For a few seconds the three lads remained
transfixed with surprise. They looked at one another,
then glanced at the closed door, and then
peered into each others’ faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry was the first to recover the use of his
voice.</p>

<p>“Did you see that, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Did we see it?” echoed Ned. “I should say
so!”</p>

<p>“What does it all mean?” asked Bob. “Why
should our old friend, Professor Snodgrass, treat
us like that—shutting the door in our faces?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t!” declared Jerry.</p>

<p>“He did!” asserted Bob. “I saw him!”</p>

<p>“You saw the door close,” went on Jerry. “But
the professor didn’t shut it. If you had been
standing where I was, you could have observed
that. There was some one else in the room who
acted for him.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” chimed in Ned. “He didn’t
even see us. He didn’t look up once from his
papers. It was the same old Professor Snodgrass—more
intent on finding out how many legs some
new kind of ant has than on his meals. Yes, the
same old professor!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure about that?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Sure of it?” reiterated Ned. “Why, of
course! Aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“You called his name out, just as we did, and
then the door went shut,” declared Bob. “You
spoke his name.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and at the time I really thought it was
the professor,” admitted Jerry. “But when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
think of what took place I begin to have my
doubts.”</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass never acted that way before,
that’s sure,” and Ned seemed siding with
Jerry Hopkins. “Every other time he’s seen us
he’s been tickled to death. This time——”</p>

<p>“He didn’t see us this time—that’s all there is
to it,” declared Jerry. “Professor Snodgrass or
not, whoever is in that room never looked up to
see us, though he—whoever he is—may have
heard us call out the name.”</p>

<p>“If it isn’t the professor who is it?” demanded
Bob.</p>

<p>“Who’s the fellow I had the row with in the
restaurant?” Jerry countered.</p>

<p>“Oh! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le cochon!</i>” Bob exclaimed. “That’s
so! He does look a lot like our friend. But not
from the front, Jerry Hopkins! Not from the
front!” he added quickly, as he recalled that circumstance,
and the fact that this time they had
had a full-face view of the man now sitting behind
the closed cabin door. “The pepper-pot looks like
the professor from the back view, but not from
the front. We proved that several times.”</p>

<p>“And besides,” went on Ned, “this isn’t the
mysterious cabin, either. There are no marines
on guard here.”</p>

<p>“I grant you that,” said Jerry, and he was smiling
at his two chums in a manner that, had they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
not been so excited, would have roused their curiosity.</p>

<p>“And this isn’t the same cabin, either!” reiterated
Ned. “The one where the marines are on
guard, and where we think the pepper-pot is held
a prisoner, is on the deck below.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that?” asked Jerry, and the
manner of his asking made both Ned and Bob
look more closely at the corridor in which they
were then standing. Next they glanced at the
closed door, noting the number, and with one accord
they exclaimed:</p>

<p>“It’s the same!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought you’d say,” remarked
Jerry, with a little nod of satisfaction. “But we
might as well hike along. No use standing here
talking over the mystery. Besides, the professor
may not like it.”</p>

<p>“I thought you said it wasn’t the professor,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“No, I only said I had my doubts,” corrected
Jerry. “I don’t really know what to think.”</p>

<p>“As you say, it’s a mystery,” conceded Bob.
“But can’t we get to the bottom of it? Say, all
sorts of things are happening on our homeward
trip. Here we are delayed because of some mysterious
explosion on board, there’s a mysterious
prisoner in a mysterious cabin guarded by marines,
and now we think we see in the same cabin the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
real professor. Say, it’s beyond me all right!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s queer,” admitted Jerry. “Let’s go
off by ourselves and talk it over.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” agreed Ned. “I guess we’ll have
enough excitement doing that not to need other
recreation.”</p>

<p>In as secluded a spot as the three Motor Boys
could find on the crowded troopship, they talked
over the incidents of the trip thus far.</p>

<p>“Then you are sure the cabin where we saw
the professor—or at least the cabin where the
door was shut so soon after we uttered his name—you’re
sure that’s the same cabin where the
marines were on guard, are you, Jerry?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Positive,” was the tall lad’s reply.</p>

<p>“But how do you account for the change?”
asked Bob. “Why are the guards withdrawn,
and why is it that this pepper-pot—if it is he in
the cabin—looks so much more like Professor
Snodgrass from the front than he did at first?”</p>

<p>“The only way I can account for that,” replied
Jerry, “is that it really is Professor Snodgrass
this time.”</p>

<p>“<em>This</em> time!” echoed Ned. “Do you mean to
say the professor is on board here?”</p>

<p>“He might be,” the tall lad admitted. “You
remember we met only the other day a fellow we
knew well. He’d been on board since the start of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
this unfortunate trip, and yet we didn’t know it
until we ran plumb into him. It may be the same
with the professor.”</p>

<p>“But he’d be sure to look us up if he were
here,” declared Bob. “He always does. He’s
very friendly, and he likes to be with us. He’d
be sure to speak to us if he were on board.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if he knew we were here,” admitted
Jerry. “But he may not. If it was he in the
cabin, where the door was just closed, you can
make up your mind he never saw us.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe he did,” assented Bob.
“But if that is the same cabin where pepper-pot
was guarded, and he’s gone now, and the real
Professor Snodgrass is in his place, how do you
account for it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t account for it,” answered Jerry, with
a smile. “All I am sure of is that this is the same
cabin where the marines were. You can be as
sure of that as I am—in fact, I guess you are sure,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Ned and Bob nodded in affirmation.</p>

<p>“Then,” went on the tall lad, “all that I am
sure of, next, is that the guards are gone. And
you must admit that it is possible for both Professor
Snodgrass and the man we call <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>
to be in that cabin at the same time, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course it is,” assented Ned. “But
from the way that pepper-pot talked of our friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
I shouldn’t think they’d want to be in the same
cabin.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they don’t want to be, but circumstances
may force them to,” suggested Jerry, with a
laugh. “Boys,” he went on, “I believe there’s
something queer going on here aboard the <i>Sherman</i>.
We’ve done our part in telling what we
know. Now it’s up to our superior officers.”</p>

<p>Ned and Bob were silent for a moment. Then
the stout lad broke the silence by saying:</p>

<p>“Well, it certainly is a mystery! I only wish
we could have a talk with Professor Snodgrass—provided
he’s here—and see what he has to say.”</p>

<p>“I wish the same thing myself,” admitted Jerry.
“And now perhaps we’d better go on with our
original plan, and see if we can do something to
organize a little fun to kill this deadly monotony
of waiting for help.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s do that,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>As they started once more on their errand a
commotion was heard on the deck above. The
shuffling of many feet told of soldiers rushing to
and fro, while there were shouts that seemed to
be those of alarm.</p>

<p>“Hello! Something else doing!” cried Ned,
as he hurried toward a companionway that led to
the upper decks.</p>

<p>The three reached the deck together, and as
they emerged into the open they were immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
enveloped in swirling clouds of white vapor.</p>

<p>“Smoke!” cried Bob. “The ship is on fire!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Jerry. “It’s a heavy
fog! Just what is to be expected when there’s a
dead calm at this time of year. We’re fog-bound,
as well as disabled.”</p>

<p>“But why should a mere fog cause such a commotion?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>Before Jerry could answer the three boys were
startled by hearing through the dim, misty whiteness
a well-known voice saying:</p>

<p>“Don’t disturb me now, and please don’t come
too close! This is the best chance I’ve had for a
long while to catch some of the mist-flies. Please
don’t interrupt me, gentlemen!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>THE FOG</small></h2>
</div>


<p>With one accord Ned, Bob, and Jerry looked
at one another, their faces close together in the
thick fog that was settling down over everything
in a white, damp pall.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any doubt of it now!” exclaimed
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I should say not!” agreed Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s the voice of Professor Snodgrass,” declared
Ned. “I’d know it among a hundred, even
if he didn’t use his characteristic talk about some
new kind of bug.”</p>

<p>“Mist-flies!” exclaimed Bob. “What are they?”</p>

<p>“Oh, some kind of insect that flies only in a fog—or
at least that’s what the professor thinks they
are,” commented Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, now that we’re sure—or almost positively
so—that Professor Snodgrass is on board,”
suggested Ned, “why not see him? Let’s call out
and let him know we’re here—within a hundred
feet of him, I should say, though this fog is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
thick that he may be several hundred feet off.
Voices carry very plainly over water and through
heavy mist. I’m going to——”</p>

<p>“You’re going to keep still—at least for a
while!” interrupted Jerry, putting his hand over
Ned’s mouth in time to prevent that energetic lad
from sending out a call to the unseen owner of
the voice which sounded so like that of Professor
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Just wait a bit,” Jerry went on, when Ned had
recovered his composure caused by the sudden
stoppage of his vocal powers. “I admit that the
voice was that of our professor, but maybe it
would spoil his plans to be recognized just now
or to meet with us.”</p>

<p>“How could it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s what I don’t know,” Jerry was frank
enough to admit. “But for some reason the professor
prefers to remain somewhat concealed. He
must have his own reason for that. Very good—it’s
his privilege. Now let’s wait until this thing
clears up.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the fog?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Partly that, yes. Great guns! isn’t it thick,
though? You could almost slice it like cheese.”</p>

<p>“It’s dangerous, too,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” assented Jerry. “This fog adds
another danger to this eventful voyage. I never
saw mist so thick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” Bob asked.</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything we can do,” Jerry declared.
“All any one can do is to wait for it to
lift. I suppose they have a means of sounding
some sort of warning signal.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t mean so much what can we do
about the fog, though that’s bad enough—seems
to take away all my appetite,” complained Chunky.
“I meant what are we going to do about Professor
Snodgrass? Now that we know he’s on board
oughtn’t we do something?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Jerry, “I believe we ought.
But not just yet. Let’s wait a while. We’ve got
plenty of time. The professor can’t get away any
more than we can, and if we start looking for
him now we may get him into some sort of mixup.
Let matters take their course for a while.”</p>

<p>“I don’t hear anything of him now,” said Ned,
listening intently. “He seems to be on the still
hunt for his new fog-bugs.”</p>

<p>Though all about them, coming through the
white mist, were murmurs of voices and the sound
caused by the movement of many bodies, neither
of the three lads had a glimpse of Professor Snodgrass.
Nor did the echo of his peculiar voice
come to them.</p>

<p>The fog seemed to be growing more dense
every minute. There was no wind to carry the
mist away, and it hung about the disabled troopship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
like some heavy, white veil. It was actually
impossible to see more than fifty feet, and then
only dimly. To peer out over the side of the
craft was to gaze into a white sea, opaque and
impenetrable. To look forward or aft was to
note the same thing. From amidships neither
stern nor bow of the <i>Sherman</i> could be seen, and
men moving about the decks actually collided with
one another.</p>

<p>“Why don’t they do something?” complained
more than one fretful voice, and it was evident
that many were under a great strain.</p>

<p>“What can they do?” asked Jerry, of one of
these complaining soldiers. “The invention hasn’t
been dreamed of that will dissipate a fog at sea.”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t the sailors fire guns, blow
horns, or something, so we won’t be run down?”
went on the other. “We’re floating around here
like a log, and we may have a crash before very
long.”</p>

<p>“I fancy they’ll start signaling soon,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“How are they going to when they can’t get
up steam for the engines?” Bob asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ve got donkey engines for hoisting
out the cargo,” remarked Jerry. “Those boilers
can make steam, and I guess it can be conveyed to
the whistles. That will warn other vessels of our
nearness. And this fog may be a good thing,
too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you figure that out?” a corporal
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll begin signaling, and we may be
heard by some craft which can help us. It’s queer
they didn’t blow the whistle when they found the
wireless wasn’t working.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they might have done that,” assented Ned.
“But I don’t agree with you, Jerry, that the blowing
of a whistle by our ship in this fog will help
us any.”</p>

<p>“Why won’t it?”</p>

<p>“Because as soon as any other ship hears our
signals she’s going to keep as far away as she can
to avoid a collision.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted the tall lad. “But I presume
there’s some sort of whistle code so they
can send out a distress call.”</p>

<p>“In that case we’ll be all right,” said Ned.
“Well, all we can do is to grin and bear it. The
fog seems to have come to stay.”</p>

<p>And this seemed true. Denser and more dense,
the white vapor closed around the slowly drifting
<i>Sherman</i>. The air was cold and damp, and it
penetrated through the clothing.</p>

<p>“What causes the fog?” asked Ned of a sailor
who rolled past the three friends as they stood at
a rail.</p>

<p>“Davy Jones, I guess,” was the answer.
“Leastways he gets his full share of ships when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
fog like this here one comes. Maybe this here
one was caused by icebergs.”</p>

<p>“Icebergs!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is the time of year they come down,
sometimes. An iceberg is cold, you know, and
when it gets in warm air it makes a fog. I’ve
been on ships more than once that bunked into
’em.”</p>

<p>“Do they do much damage?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Damage!” cried the sailor. “Say, did you
ever see a little automobile, the lightest kind there
is, going full speed, hit a solid wall of rock?”</p>

<p>“I can imagine what would happen,” admitted
Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what happens when a ship strikes
an iceberg,” returned the sailor. “Course we’re
not speeding, but if we hit about fifty thousand
tons of ice—Aye, aye, sir!” he answered in response
to a call from one of the mates, and he
moved off through the mist.</p>

<p>“Pleasant prospect,” mused Jerry.</p>

<p>“Let’s don’t think about it,” urged Bob. “Say,
I wish we’d stayed in France a few months longer.
This being picked to be among the first to go
home isn’t as nice as it sounds.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll come out of this all right,” asserted
Jerry. “Now let’s consider what’s best to
be done in case there is another accident in the
fog. We ought to try to find out where Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Snodgrass is. He’ll never think of trying to save
himself if he has as much as one bug to occupy
his mind. We’d better try to locate him.”</p>

<p>“I thought you said we wouldn’t force ourselves
on him for fear of spoiling his plans,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>“We won’t exactly force ourselves on him,”
was Jerry’s answer. “But we can inquire from
the purser where our friend is placed. That may
be his regular cabin where we saw him, or he
may only have stepped in there. Once we know
where he is we can go there and see that he gets
out in case there’s a crash.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a good idea,” agreed Ned and
Bob.</p>

<p>They were on their way to the purser, who
might be expected to know the names of all on
board who were not strictly members of the military
force, when they heard from above the deep,
hoarse note of a whistle.</p>

<p>“Is that ours?” asked Ned quickly.</p>

<p>“Sounded so,” replied Jerry. “But it may be
that another ship is near. Let’s go up and see.”</p>

<p>They hurried on deck to learn that it was their
own fog signal whistle which had started sending
out its hoarse warning. Steam had been generated
in one of the donkey hoisting engine boilers, and,
by means of a hastily rigged pipe line, conveyed to
the big whistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>On this there now sounded warning blasts which
would tell to other craft in the vicinity the nearness
of a ship. And, as the three chums listened,
they heard the blasts given in peculiar order—as
though spelling out some code word.</p>

<p>“Is that saying anything?” asked Ned of a
sailor who loomed up through the mist.</p>

<p>“Yes, that tells whoever hears it that we’re
drifting, out of control, and need help.”</p>

<p>“Will help come?”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows,” was the answer. “I don’t
believe any other ship would take a chance on
coming too close while the fog holds.”</p>

<p>And the fog still held. Like a white blanket it
wrapped the transport in its folds, hiding from
view everything except in a fifty-foot circle.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE CRASH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>With moisture fairly dripping from their garments,
hanging in beads from their eyebrows, and
seeming to penetrate to their innermost being, as
water does a sponge, Ned, Bob and Jerry stood
at the rail of the transport moodily discussing the
situation.</p>

<p>Yes, they were moody. It was, indeed, enough
to make any one moody, though perhaps they
should have been thankful that their lives were
spared and that they were able to be up on deck,
and not obliged to lie stretched on a cot in the sick
bay. But the boys thought they had just cause
for grievance, and perhaps they had.</p>

<p>Certainly to be disabled far out at sea was bad
enough, without having to be fog-bound, to run
the risk of crashing into some other vessel, having
some big steamer, or perhaps a war craft,
crash into them, or bear down on an immense iceberg
which might be the cause of the very fog that
would hasten their destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>And so, gloomily and moodily, the three Cresville
lads leaned against the rail, straining their
eyes to pierce the misty whiteness that enveloped
them so closely. Every now and then the hoarse
bellow of the steamer’s whistle would sound out
its warning and call—for the blasts were so
sounded as to form the international call for help.
And, punctuating the whistle blasts, was the clang
of the fog bell, rung insistently by sailors detailed
for this important task.</p>

<p>Meanwhile all that could be done was to watch
and wait—wait for the inevitable. Would the
fog lift before some fatal crash? or would they
be further endangered by its opaqueness? No
one could answer.</p>

<p>Lookouts were stationed at every vantage point.
Men were sent up to the crow’s nests on the masts,
but from there they reported that they could see
no more than could be observed from the deck.
Their eyes were useless beyond a distance of fifty
feet.</p>

<p>“This is fierce!” exclaimed Ned, and he closed
his eyes for a moment, for they actually ached
from the strain he was putting on them by trying
to see the unseeable.</p>

<p>“You said something!” commented Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it might be worse,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>“How could it be?” half-fiercely demanded
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“We might not be afloat in a sound ship, for
one thing,” the tall lad answered. “Of course we
can’t move under our own power, but we’re in
no danger of sinking.”</p>

<p>“No—not yet,” muttered Bob significantly.
“But there’s no telling how long we may be this
way. Look at those sails! Might as well hang
up a couple of pocket handkerchiefs!” and he motioned
to the great expanses of canvas between
the wireless masts.</p>

<p>They did, indeed, hang as limp as clothes on a
line. Not a whiff of wind swayed them, and the
moisture of the fog, condensing on their white
surfaces, dripped down to the deck.</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t do anything to remedy it,” said
Jerry, after a pause. “Might as well grin and
bear it.”</p>

<p>“What do you say to looking up Professor
Snodgrass?” asked Bob. “That is, I don’t mean
go directly to him, for he might have, as Jerry
says, some special reason for not wanting to be
disturbed. But if he’s here on board—and we’re
sure, now, that he is—we could ask of some of the
officers and, perhaps, let him know we’re here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s do that!” added Ned. “We started
to, but got off the track.”</p>

<p>Jerry considered the matter a moment. Then
he said:</p>

<p>“I guess we might as well. We’ll want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
know where he is, anyhow, in case of accident, so
we can look after him. Let’s go!”</p>

<p>On board the transport the same sort of military
rules and regulations that existed in camp or on
the battlefield did not hold good. There was
more freedom and ease in going about and in
making inquiries, and the Motor Boys proceeded
to take advantage of this.</p>

<p>Their first inquiries, however, of some of the
ship’s officers resulted in disappointment. No one
seemed to know Professor Snodgrass. They admitted
that there were several civilians on board
the transport, but were not aware of their names.</p>

<p>Some said they had seen a man resembling the
description given of Professor Snodgrass, but
when pressed for details they described the individual
the boys had dubbed “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>,” and the
Motor Boys did not want to meet him again.</p>

<p>They even made their way to the passage where
the marines had been on sentry duty in front of
the mysterious cabin, and, somewhat to their surprise,
found the men on guard. They were not
the same men they had seen at first, but two burly
soldiers who gruffly bade the boys:</p>

<p>“Move on!”</p>

<p>“This certainly is queer,” declared Bob, when
they were out of earshot of the two marines.
“One time they have a guard there, and another
time they don’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder why,” voiced Ned.</p>

<p>“Can’t you guess?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No. Tell us!” urged his chums.</p>

<p>“Well, I should think it would occur to you that
the marines are not guarding the cabin—just some
one in it. And if he isn’t there——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“You mean pepper-pot was out of the cabin the
other time we were here and we saw Professor
Snodgrass inside?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“About that,” answered Jerry, smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a white horse of another color,”
remarked Ned. “Professor Snodgrass must have
been in pepper-pot’s cabin when our volatile acquaintance,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>, was out of it. Now that
the little man who looks like our friend is there
again, the guards are once more on duty. How’s
that, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“That’s about the way I size it up.”</p>

<p>“Well, now that we’ve got thus far let’s keep
on,” suggested Bob. “Let’s find where the professor
is.”</p>

<p>“Why not ask the guards?” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“We can try,” agreed Chunky. “But they
didn’t seem very friendly.”</p>

<p>Nor were they when the friends essayed a few
questions. The chief one being as to whether or
not the marines knew where Professor Snodgrass
could be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go chase yourself,” was all the reply the boys
received.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re on our own now, so let’s make a
hunt,” suggested Jerry. “He’s somewhere on this
ship, and a man with all the peculiarities of Professor
Snodgrass can’t be hidden long.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” assented his chums.</p>

<p>And the search began. How long the three
might have been searching, unaided as they were
by any information given in response to their
many questions, is doubtful. Probably if they had
been able to find the purser he would have solved
the riddle for them at once.</p>

<p>But that official was not to be found. Doubtless,
with the added responsibilities that had come
with the accident to the ship he was in great demand
and was not long in any one place.</p>

<p>At any rate Ned, Bob and Jerry could not find
him, and no one in his department would give them
the information they sought. The transport being
so large and so crowded, the professor was almost
as well hidden as though he were in some large
city and no one had his address.</p>

<p>As it was, chance came to the aid of the three
boys. They were wandering about, now and
then going up on deck to see if the fog had lifted,
coming down again, disappointed because it had
not, when, as they were watching a group of sailors
putting fresh water in some of the boats that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
were always kept in readiness for instant use, they
heard a well-remembered voice saying:</p>

<p>“Just a moment, now! Just a moment, I beg
of you. Don’t stir hand or foot!”</p>

<p>“And why shouldn’t I stir hand or foot?” asked
a truculent voice. “Do you think I can stand here
all day while you’re creepin’ up on me like a
scalping Indian?”</p>

<p>“One moment! Only a second more, I beg
of you!” went on the first voice. “There is on
your left leg one of the finest specimens of sea-leech
I have ever seen, and I want him!”</p>

<p>“A leech! You’re welcome to him!” cried the
other voice, and through the fog the three boys
saw looming a strange sight.</p>

<p>A sailor was swabbing part of the deck, and he
stood with his mop half raised from the pail while
stealthily approaching him was the figure of a little
bald-headed man, wearing across his nose powerful
spectacles.</p>

<p>And it needed but a moment’s glance at the little
man to show that he was none other than Professor
Snodgrass. Bob impulsively murmured his
name.</p>

<p>The little scientist, edging his way along the
fog-wreathed deck toward the poised sailor, gave
one glance and noticed the three chums.</p>

<p>“Oh, boys! Glad to see you!” he exclaimed,
as though they had just left him the day before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
“Please don’t move. I am about to make a most
important capture. One moment, my friend.
Don’t stir hand or foot. In a moment——”</p>

<p>The professor’s words were interrupted by a
chorus of terrific shouts. There was a confusion
of voices, mingling with the frantic clanging of a
bell and the hoarse tooting of the big whistle.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry caught a glimpse of something
big and black looming up on the port side
out of the fog.</p>

<p>A moment later there was a terrific crash, and
it seemed as if the transport would be heeled over
and capsized. The fear-anticipated collision had
happened!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>A WAIF OF THE SEA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry Hopkins felt himself being tossed
through space. That is to say, he felt himself
moving through space; but, as a matter of fact,
he did not at that instant know whether he had
been tossed or was merely falling. There was
blackness before his eyes, caused, as he learned
later, by a blow on the head, and even if that had
not been the case he could have seen little, for the
fog, after the collision, seemed to settle down
heavier than before.</p>

<p>Jerry had a confused idea that he was shouting
something. What it was he did not know, but as
there was a riot of shouts going on all about him
it did not much matter.</p>

<p>The crash had stunned him for the time being.
It had shaken him through and through and disturbed
his logical thinking powers. He found
time to wonder what had happened to his chums,
Ned and Bob, and also to Professor Snodgrass.
Was it not queer how they had so unexpectedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
met him, and in a characteristic occupation—that
of gathering a rare bug unsuspectingly harbored
by some innocent spectator?</p>

<p>What had happened to Bob, Ned, and the professor?
Did he get the bug he was after? What
had become of the surprised sailor?</p>

<p>These, and other thoughts, rushed through the
mind of Jerry Hopkins in a series of flashes, like
the views on a moving picture screen. He instinctively
flung out his hands to protect himself when
he should land, and then——</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt himself being immersed in deep
water. He had fallen into the sea—he realized
that—and the sudden shock cleared his partially
numbed brain. Instinctively Jerry held his breath
as his head went under, and then he began frantically
striking out. He was a strong swimmer, and,
even fully dressed as he was, he knew how to take
care of himself in the water.</p>

<p>Giving his head a shake to clear his eyes, he
looked about him. He wanted to see, if possible,
in what direction to swim to save himself. If he
had been tossed any distance from the transport
he might be some time before he could swim back
to her. And it might be better to try to reach the
vessel that had crashed into the <i>Sherman</i>.</p>

<p>Then another thought occurred to Jerry. Was
it another vessel that had crashed into the troopship
in the fog? Might it not have been some immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
iceberg, which, even now, was bearing down
on the swimming lad?</p>

<p>And then Jerry, in a measure, pulled himself together.
He knew that to dwell on such gloomy
thoughts was hampering his powers of resistance—taking
from him his own self-control that he
very much needed at this time. So, vigorously
putting them aside, he increased the power of his
strokes, though he was beginning to feel the weight
of his soaked garments. Again he shook his head
to clear his eyes and looked about him for something
toward which to swim. All about him was
the dense, white fog. He looked for something
black looming up through it—the black side of
the troopship, or perhaps the side of the vessel
which had crashed into the <i>Sherman</i>.</p>

<p>And then, like a flash, it came to Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, it won’t be black!”</p>

<p>For a moment that simple thought, which came
in the form of a sentence he might have seen written
down, puzzled the lad.</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t it be black?” he asked himself,
even as he swam about. And then came the subconscious
answer.</p>

<p>“Camouflage paint!”</p>

<p>That was it! Why hadn’t he thought of it before?</p>

<p>“If our vessel was camouflaged, as she was,”
reasoned Jerry, “the other might be also. I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
got to look for something like that and not the
ordinary black-painted side of a ship. Glad I
thought of that. But it’s going to be harder to
watch for.”</p>

<p>One thing was in his favor—the sea was calm.
The absence of wind for several days had made
the ocean like some smooth lake, and there was
only a long, gentle swell on the crests of which
Jerry rose and fell as he swam onward.</p>

<p>But though he strained his eyes, which smarted
somewhat from the salt water, he could see no
fantastically camouflaged side of a vessel toward
which he might make his way to safety.</p>

<p>“This is queer,” he found himself reasoning.
“I couldn’t have fallen a great way from the <i>Sherman</i>
or the other ship. I must have been swimming
the wrong way in the fog. I’ll turn back.”</p>

<p>He turned squarely around—as nearly as he
could judge the direction in the fog—and began
striking out again. And just as he was beginning
to wonder why it was he did not see something,
his ears became aware of a confused shouting off
to his left; at least he thought it was his left.</p>

<p>“There she is! There’s the <i>Sherman</i>!” Jerry
told himself. “I’ve been headed wrong! Why
didn’t I hear that noise before?”</p>

<p>Then his ears felt as though warm water had
suddenly run out of them from inside his head,
and he knew what had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Both ears had filled with water when he took
his plunge into the sea, and this had temporarily
deafened him. He always had had trouble that
way, even when a small lad, and he used to wear
wads of cotton in his ears when he went for a
swim. He remembered that on several occasions
he had feared he was going deaf, only to feel,
later, the sensation of warm water running from
his ears, and then his hearing returned.</p>

<p>The explanation was simple. Jerry’s inner ears
filled with water. It became warmed up to nearly
98 degrees by his blood, and then, expanding with
the heat, was forced out naturally. Once his ears
were clear of water, he could hear as well as before.
And that accounted for the fact that he now
suddenly heard the shouting which, probably, had
been going on all the while he was in the water.</p>

<p>“I’m all right now,” decided the tall lad. “I
know which way to swim.”</p>

<p>He really thought he did, though, as it turned
out later, he had mistaken the direction of the
noise. And as he swam on, blissfully unconscious
of the fact that he was going farther and farther
away from the <i>Sherman</i> instead of nearer to it,
another thought came to Jerry. He expressed it
subconsciously:</p>

<p>“Why don’t I hear some whistling or some other
noise from the vessel that crashed into us?”</p>

<p>That was it—why did he not? Once his ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
had cleared, Jerry could continue to catch the
sound of distant shouting, and also the periodic
whistling of the <i>Sherman</i>—he well knew the tones
of that instrument. But he did not hear any corresponding
note from the other ship that had
been in the collision.</p>

<p>“She ought to be whistling, too,” decided Jerry.
“Maybe she’s damaged, and maybe some of her
men have been knocked overboard as I was. She
ought to be whistling.”</p>

<p>But on that mist-covered sea there seemed to
be but one vessel in the neighborhood of the swimming
lad—and that was the transport which he
was vainly endeavoring to find.</p>

<p>Then, like a flash, one of his previous thoughts
came to Jerry Hopkins.</p>

<p>“An iceberg can’t whistle!”</p>

<p>That must be it. An iceberg had been responsible
for the crash, and even now was out there,
somewhere, in the fog.</p>

<p>“<i>Sherman</i> ahoy!” cried Jerry desperately.</p>

<p>He listened, but there came no answer. The
tumult and the shouting seemed to have died
away. Was he leaving the vicinity of the transport,
or was she being borne from him in the
frozen grip of a mountainous berg?</p>

<p>Just for an instant, but for an instant only, Jerry
lost hope and courage.<a href="#image03"> He seemed to want to
cease swimming and let himself sink.</a> Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
got control of himself again, and struck out more
vigorously than before.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_130">HE SEEMED TO WANT TO CEASE SWIMMING AND LET

</div>

<p>“I’m not going to die! I’m not going to die!”</p>

<p>This he told himself over and over again,
fiercely.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to quit! I’m not going to be a
quitter!”</p>

<p>He felt better when he said this over once or
twice. He was beginning to feel weary, but he
would not allow his mind to dwell on that. His
brain forced his legs and arms to do their duty.</p>

<p>And then, when for perhaps the fiftieth time
he had feverishly repeated: “I’m not going to be
a quitter!” Jerry became aware of something
looming up before him out of the fog. At first
he took it to be merely but a thicker cloud of the
white mist, and then he imagined it to be the dirty
white of some iceberg.</p>

<p>But a moment later he knew it for what it was—the
camouflaged side of a vessel.</p>

<p>“I’ve found the <i>Sherman</i>!” cried Jerry aloud.
“On board the transport!” he yelled. “Throw
me a line!”</p>

<p>Nothing but silence greeted him. In growing
wonder and fear he swam along the side of the
craft. The waves rose and fell along it lazily,
now raising, again lowering him.</p>

<p>What did it mean? Was the <i>Sherman</i> so badly
damaged that she was sinking and had been abandoned?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
This could hardly have taken place so
quickly. There would have been some boats remaining
in the vicinity. But no, there was not a
sign.</p>

<p>“Ahoy the <i>Sherman</i>!” yelled Jerry.</p>

<p>No answer. He swam along the side. He
came upon a dangling rope, and, by the exercise
of his last-remaining strength, he managed to
reach the deck.</p>

<p>Then one look told him the story. It was a
derelict that had crashed into the <i>Sherman</i>, and
Jerry Hopkins was now aboard this waif of the
sea.</p>

<small>NED WONDERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When the crash had come Ned Slade felt himself
thrown back against a deck stanchion, which
he grasped desperately. In the instant of the collision,
or so immediately following it as to make
it seem simultaneous, he had observed a big hole
torn in the side of the <i>Sherman</i>.</p>

<p>Stunned and shaken, he clung to the stanchion
while all about him were confused shouts and orders
and the rushing to and fro of many feet.</p>

<p>Almost as if in a dream, Ned saw the dark
shape that had smashed into the troopship slowly
back away—pull itself out of the great gash that
had been cut. Then the fog swallowed it up.</p>

<p>He had slid to the deck after being hurled
against the stanchion, and now he pulled himself
to his feet again. As he did so he saw himself
surrounded by a number of officers and men who
had not been standing near him when the crash
came. They looked from Ned to the hole in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
side of the transport, and then out into the fog.</p>

<p>“What was it?” some one asked.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” confusedly murmured Ned.
And then it occurred to him that he did know—that
he had seen exactly what had happened. So
he answered: “A steamer crashed into us. She’s
out there!”</p>

<p>He pointed to the mist that was thicker than
ever.</p>

<p>“What ship was it?”</p>

<p>“Did you see the name?”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t she stand by and give assistance?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice what the name was,” he managed
to answer. “She just crashed into us—right
here—and then she backed out.” He pointed to
the gaping hole.</p>

<p>“Queer she backed out again,” commented a
ship’s officer. “She might better have held her
nose in the hole. That is, if it’s below the water
line. But it isn’t,” he added quickly, as he leaned
over the rail to take an observation. “We’re safe,
so far. The lowest part of the hole is above the
water line. But why doesn’t she let us know who
she is? Why doesn’t she signal?”</p>

<p>It was queer, the absolute absence of sound
from the other craft. Except for that gaping hole,
it was as though she had been a figment of the
imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“She doesn’t whistle,” said the officer, who had
looked over the side, “and I don’t hear any shouting.
Surely she’s still near enough for us to hear
from her. Are you sure it was a vessel?” he
asked Ned. “Who else was here with you at the
time?”</p>

<p>That question gave Ned a shock. That was it!
Who had been with him at the time?</p>

<p>Why of course Jerry, Bob and Professor Snodgrass.
And there was some one else—the sailor
from whose person the little scientist had been
about to remove a bug. It all came back to Ned
now.</p>

<p>“Are you sure it was a vessel?” the officer asked
again. “It may have been an iceberg. I’ve been
bumped by them more than once.”</p>

<p>“It was a vessel,” answered Ned, and his mind
was struggling with two matters. One was to answer
the questions put to him, and the other was
to try to think what had become of Bob, Jerry and
the professor. He was confusing things.</p>

<p>“It was a vessel,” he went on. “I could see the
camouflage paint on her. She slammed right into
us and then backed off.”</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” murmured the officer. “If she
was under steam she could blow her whistle, and
even if she was disabled, as we are, she could
ring a bell. But there isn’t a sound.”</p>

<p>“It must have been an iceberg,” declared another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
officer. “That would account for everything—even
the silence.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t an iceberg!” declared Ned. “I saw
the camouflage paint. And look! You can see
where some of it is scraped off on the broken end
of our rail.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a jagged timber. It was true.
Amid the splinters were flecks of blue and white
paint.</p>

<p>“He’s right!” assented the first officer. “Besides,
if it was an iceberg there’d be chunks of it
on our decks now. And there isn’t a cubic inch.
It was another ship!”</p>

<p>“But what kind?” cried several. “Why doesn’t
she signal us and see if she can help?”</p>

<p>The officer had an answer ready for that question.
He had not sailed the seven seas without
knowing something of the mysteries of the vast
places.</p>

<p>“A derelict,” he said.</p>

<p>“A derelict!” came the chorus. Then they understood.</p>

<p>Then came a barrage of questions, chief among
them being:</p>

<p>“How could an abandoned derelict back away?”</p>

<p>“She probably didn’t,” the first officer said.
“The shock of the collision probably separated us,
and a stray current did the rest. I only hope she
keeps away from us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The first excitement following the crash having
passed, it remained to make certain just how
badly damaged the <i>Sherman</i> was and to ascertain
the number of her crew and passengers who had
been injured.</p>

<p>A hasty examination disclosed the fact that the
hole in the side was well above the water line.
Except in the event of a storm the transport would
not leak. And, even in that case, the flooding of
one more compartment would not be fatal.</p>

<p>In regard to the personal damage, though, the
troopship had not come off so well. Several had
been killed when the prow of the derelict had bit
into the <i>Sherman’s</i> side, for several decks were
involved in the damage done, and all along the
rails, at the point of the crash, men had been
standing. Doctors and nurses found themselves
with many new casual cases to look after, as well
as those with which they had started out. The
dead, of course, were beyond help, and their
poor, maimed bodies were tenderly laid aside.
There were some of the injured whose recovery
was in doubt, but others were only slightly
hurt.</p>

<p>But military discipline, added to that of the
naval officers, soon brought comparative order out
of chaos, and then, or even before, boats were
lowered to pick up any who might have been tossed
by the collision into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>One or two of these were picked up floating
near the <i>Sherman</i>, and some had been hurt.</p>

<p>Just how many were missing could not be ascertained
until the lists were gone over. But Ned
lost no time after a hasty survey of those picked
up in telling that Jerry, Bob and Professor Snodgrass,
all of whom had been talking with him a
moment before the crash, were not to be found.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a thorough search made,” said the
ship’s captain, when Ned’s story was repeated.
“If necessary I’ll keep boats cruising about all
night.”</p>

<p>And he did. Sailors, marines, and soldiers
formed searching parties in lifeboats, but they
were handicapped by the fog. They dared not
go far away from the <i>Sherman</i> for fear of being
lost themselves, and their shouts brought no response.
Some floating wreckage was picked up,
part of it from the troopship and some from the
unknown derelict. “Unknown” because nothing
that was found afloat after the crash disclosed her
identity.</p>

<p>“But what has become of Jerry, Bob and the
professor?” wondered Ned. “They were with
me. Their bodies are not among the dead—I’m
thankful for that—nor are they in the list of
wounded. They weren’t picked up by the boats.
But where are they?”</p>

<p>And as Ned wondered and wondered the fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
conviction was borne to him that his three
friends must have been injured or killed by the
crash and have been flung into the sea, their bodies
at once sinking.</p>

<small>A QUEER CRAFT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Bob Baker and Professor Snodgrass struck
the water at the same moment, and side by side.
They plunged downward together and came up
at the same time. And then, with seemingly the
same thought, they both struck out for a bit of
wreckage. They reached this—a jagged mass of
wood which was large enough to partially support
them in the water.</p>

<p>Bob was, because of his stoutness, rather fortunate
in the water. He floated well, and he was
by no means a bad swimmer. As for Professor
Snodgrass, in spite of his preoccupation at times,
he had mastered the art of keeping himself afloat
in the water, and was really well able to look out
for himself. So he had not much difficulty.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Professor?” gasped Bob, as
soon as he had cleared his eyes and mouth of some
of the salty water that had entered.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t seem to be,” gasped the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
scientist. “This was rather unfortunate, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“If you mean being tossed overboard, I’ll say
it was,” replied Bob, hardly meaning his answer
to take that army-slang phraseology. “But it’s
lucky we found this bit of wreckage. It will keep
us up, without our having to swim, for some time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that was lucky,” agreed the professor.
“But what I meant was it’s too bad I didn’t
get that bug when I had the chance. I refer to the
one on the sailor. Very rare bug, that. I almost
had it when the crash came. I wonder if he’ll be
there when we get back?”</p>

<p>“The bug?” asked Bob, unable to restrain a
smile.</p>

<p>“Well, the bug and the sailor. Those bugs
cling, once they get fastened on a person or object.
If that sailor hasn’t been tossed overboard,
like ourselves, I may be able to get my specimen
after all when we get back.”</p>

<p>“If we do get back,” put in Bob, as he took an
easier position on the bit of wreckage and looked
about him.</p>

<p>“Get back! Why shouldn’t we get back?” asked
Professor Snodgrass. “All we’ve got to do is to
cling here until they send a boat for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so,” half agreed Bob. “But if
they can’t see to pick us up, and we drift much
farther apart, why——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not need to say more. The little
scientist looked about and saw the white fog enveloping
them. It was answer enough.</p>

<p>“This surely is unfortunate,” went on the little
bald-headed man. “I need just that one bug to
complete my collection, and if we don’t return soon
some one else may get it.”</p>

<p>“Who’d want it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Why Dr. Hallet, of course,” was the answer,
as if there could be no other. “I’ve had to fight
tooth and nail the last month to keep him from securing
things that really belong to me. And now
that I am in this unfortunate position he may get
ahead of me. There is only one hope.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Bob. “Do you see a
boat coming for us?”</p>

<p>“No. The hope I refer to is that the sailor on
whom I saw that bug may remember that I have
first claim to it. He may save it for me and not
let Dr. Hallet get it.”</p>

<p>“Is Dr. Hallet on board?” asked Bob, beginning
to get a glimmer of light on some matters
that had puzzled him and his chums during the
past few days.</p>

<p>“Well, he was at the time I left,” announced the
professor. “But he, too, may have been tossed
overboard as we were. If he was, I hope
he doesn’t want to get aboard our present craft.
There is hardly room for one more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, indeed,” agreed Bob. “But, say, Professor,
we ought to do something.”</p>

<p>“Do what, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Shout and yell to let ’em know we’re out here.
They’ll send a boat for us. Come on, yell!”</p>

<p>Accordingly they blended their voices, far from
musically, but into what they hoped would prove
to be an appeal for help. Whether it was effective
or not they could not tell, as the fog shut them
in like a great white blanket.</p>

<p>“If we could manage to propel our craft in the
direction of the ship we might be saved sooner,”
said Professor Snodgrass. “What do you imagine
hit us, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Oh, some sort of ship—derelict, I imagine,
because I didn’t hear any whistle before the crash.
Ours was the only one going. It wasn’t an iceberg—I
know that. I had a glimpse of something
big looming up in front of me, then I heard and
felt the crash, and—here we are!”</p>

<p>“Yes, here we are!” agreed the professor.
“And the next matter to consider is—what are we
going to do?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to hold on to what we have until
we can get something better,” the Motor Boy decided,
after a moment of thought. “If we smashed
the other ship up much, or she smashed us, there’ll
be a lot of wreckage floating around soon, and
we may be able to pick up a bigger piece. As it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
is, I think you can get on this one, Professor, and
let me swim behind and push it. In that way we
can make better progress, and may get back to
the transport.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that would be a good plan, Bob.
But why can’t we both get on this bit of wreckage?”</p>

<p>“Won’t hold us,” was the answer. “It’s just
big enough for you. I’m too fat. Besides, I guess
I can stand it better swimming and pushing than
you. I’ll get off some of my things, though, and
make it easier.”</p>

<p>Partly supporting himself on the mass of wreckage,
Bob removed his shoes, trousers and coat,
and remained in his underwear, which did not form
a bad bathing suit.</p>

<p>His garments he rolled up and stuffed into a big
crack in the mass of timbers and boards.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass was small and light, and
when he had managed, with Bob’s help, to clamber
up on the wreckage he found he had a fairly
comfortable position compared to being unsupported
in the water. Nor did he submerge the
mass very much.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” the professor
asked, as he settled himself on the middle of the
mass.</p>

<p>“Try to get back to the <i>Sherman</i>,” Bob answered.
“She can’t be very far away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better yell again?” asked Professor
Snodgrass, after a period of silence. “We
ought to let them know we’re here.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Bob, “we had.”</p>

<p>Now, again, they raised their voices, but after
several trials, there came no answer.</p>

<p>“They must have got up steam, and are going
away from us,” said Bob. “Or else they’ve
sunk,” he added, after a moment.</p>

<p>“I can hardly believe that,” answered the professor.
“The blow struck by the derelict, as you
say it was, I am sure was not hard enough to sink
our ship so soon. Besides, if she had gone down
we’d see signs of more wreckage, or the lifeboats.
As it is, we have seen nothing.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” admitted Bob. “It surely is
queer.”</p>

<p>Bob Baker had paused in his efforts to push the
raft, and now was resting himself while he held
this conversation with his friend.</p>

<p>He was about to start to swimming again
when the professor began quickly to remove his
coat, shoes, and trousers.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” cried Bob, wondering
if the shock had suddenly sent his scientific
friend mad.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop me!” cried Professor Snodgrass.
“I’ve just got to get it!”</p>

<p>An instant later he dived overboard, and Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
was about to swim around and catch hold of him,
when he saw the little man’s object.</p>

<p>Just ahead of the raft was a mass of floating
seaweed, and on it, or entangled in it, were several
forms of marine life—a crab, a radiolite
and one or two others.</p>

<p>“There’s enough here for a month of study!”
cried the professor, as he swam back to the raft
with his prize. “Oh, if I only had my microscope
and notebook here. But they are back on
the transport. Oh, if she should be sunk what
a loss it would be!”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” agreed Bob, as he helped
steady the raft while the little bald-headed man,
holding the mass of weeds he had secured,
climbed “on board” again. “Think of the lives
that would be lost!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that would be awful,” agreed his companion.
“But I would lose a most wonderful
collection of specimens and much valuable data
concerning them. That rascally Dr. Hallet
would get them if he could.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked Bob. “Is he that mysterious
individual who was in the guarded cabin?
the little man who looks like you from behind,
with whom Jerry had the row, and who——”</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” suddenly cried the professor,
holding to his bunch of seaweed with one hand
and with the other stuffing his removed clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
into a crack of the raft so they would not be
washed away. “Look! There’s a boat after
us!”</p>

<p>Bob looked in the direction of the pointing
finger and saw, dimly through the fog, a white
object of considerable size, at least as compared
to their improvised vessel. It floated well up
out of the water, and as the drifting currents
brought the two nearer Bob saw that it was a
ship’s life raft. It consisted of two large steel
cylinders, filled with air and sealed. Between
them was a platform and a raised object which
Bob knew was a water-tight box, or locker, containing
food and water.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried the professor. “There he is!
There he is! Oh, I hope the bug is still on him!”</p>

<p>And then Bob observed that the life raft held
a lone occupant. It was a sailor, and it needed
only a second glance to show that it was the same
man from whom Professor Snodgrass had been
about to remove a “specimen,” when the crash
came.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant that Bob and the
professor observed the lone sailor on the life
raft, the man noticed them. He stared a moment,
then waved his hand in greeting and called:</p>

<p>“Are you alive?”</p>

<p>“Very much so!” answered Bob. “Have you
room for us there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Plenty and to spare,” was the answer. “This
raft is built to hold twelve. Wait, I’ll row over
to you!”</p>

<p>Then Bob saw that the queer craft was provided
with oars; and though it moved clumsily
in the water it progressed toward him and the
professor. The latter gave one look and observing
that substantial help was on the way, he began
to examine the specimens in the bunch of seaweed.
Not before he had called out, however
to the sailor:</p>

<p>“Don’t lose that bug, whatever you do!”</p>

<p>“Bug! Lose the bug! Sure, and the man’s
plumb daft!” Bob heard the old salt mutter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>A LONE NAVIGATOR</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry Hopkins stood in a pool of sea water
on the deck of the derelict to which he had
climbed after having been immersed in the ocean
for more than an hour. Every seam of his garments
seemed to spew out a little puddle of
dampness, and he said afterward that he felt
not unlike a sponge. But for the time being,
wonder at his new situation and thankfulness that
he was on something more substantial than a
wave overpowered every other emotion.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m here, but where am I?” mused
Jerry. “I wonder what vessel this is and how long
she will remain afloat? Anyhow, if she does go
under I can make a raft of something to keep
afloat on. This isn’t half bad. Now let’s see
where I’m at!”</p>

<p>Jerry knew that the best thing for him to do
was to get some dry clothes on, provided he
could find any, or, if not, to get his wet ones off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and let them dry. The weather was cold and
damp, and the fog still prevailed, so much so
that he could only see part of the deck of the derelict
at a time.</p>

<p>The refugee also felt the need of food and
something hot to drink, for though it was not
winter his immersion in the sea, coupled to the
fact that the last few days had been damp, cold
ones, had not served to raise his vitality.</p>

<p>“But first I’m going to see if any one else is on
board,” mused Jerry, as he moved about, first,
however, removing his soaked coat and trousers.
His shoes he had loosed and let drop into the
ocean soon after he began swimming.</p>

<p>“This is as good as a bathing suit, in case I
meet any one,” mused the lad, as he glanced
down at his underwear. “And I can’t stand those
wet things. There must be bunks aboard, if
nothing else, and I can crawl into one after a
bit. But first I’m going to look about.”</p>

<p>He did not pause long to ascertain what sort
of craft it was on which he found himself. That
it was a derelict, and that it was probably the one
that had crashed into the <i>Sherman</i>, or the craft
into which the troopship had crashed, was very
evident to Jerry Hopkins. That it was a derelict
was sure, for there was not a sign of life on
deck, nor was the vessel under command. There
was no vestige of sail, and no smoke came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
her single funnel, nor was there any vibration to
tell of engines in motion.</p>

<p>Jerry made a quick tour of the deck, moving
swiftly to restore his partially suspended circulation.
The vessel showed many evidences of
damage, whether by shell fire or collision Jerry
could not determine. Her rails were broken in
many places, and all her boats were gone except
a broken one on the port davits. Looking over
the side as best he could the lad decided that
there was not much damage below the water line,
or, if there were punctures, the bulkheads confined
the leakage to one small section.</p>

<p>“She floats pretty well,” mused Jerry, after
he had made a tour of the craft and had seen no
one on the deck. “She may ride quite a while
yet. There’s no one up here, that’s sure, but that
isn’t saying there mayn’t be some one below.
I’m going to look.”</p>

<p>The sea was calm and the vessel rode on an
almost even keel, so the lad had no difficulty in
going below. In spite of her comparatively small
size, the derelict contained many places where
persons might be either in hiding, or perhaps ill
or dead. But Jerry moved quickly about below,
using his knowledge of ships which was not small,
and as he moved here and there he shouted.</p>

<p>The echoes of his own voice were the only
answers he received, and when he had penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to the engine room, and even to the stokehold,
and had seen the boilers cold and dead, and not
a soul in sight, he came to the most natural conclusion.</p>

<p>“I’m all alone here!” he exclaimed aloud.
Somehow, it seemed less lonely to speak in this
way. “Well, since I’ve got to entertain myself,”
mused Jerry whimsically, “I’m going to see if
there is anything I can wear and anything I can
eat. Might as well be as comfortable as I can
since I’m to be ‘cook and captain too, and mate’
of this derelict. Wonder what her name is, anyhow?”</p>

<p>A look at the one remaining lifeboat—useless
as it was,—showed painted on her bow the
words: “<i>Altaire</i>, New York.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of her,” mused the lad. “She’s
probably some small tramp steamer, and maybe
was doing a sort of free and easy freight business
to Europe. The Germans caught her and—good-night!
She must have been floating around
for some time, though.”</p>

<p>Going below again, out of the cold, damp fog,
Jerry came upon what he took to be the cabin
of the captain or one of the mates. It bore evidences
of having been ransacked, but there was
clothing scattered about, as was the case in adjoining
cabins, and Jerry at once stripped, rubbed
himself down well until his whole body was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
a glow, and then he dressed himself in the best
of what he found. It was rather nondescript,
to say the least.</p>

<p>“But I’m warm, and that’s a whole lot,” reasoned
the lone navigator. “And as there’s no
one to see me, who cares how I look?”</p>

<p>Warmly clad, though somewhat regretting that
he was no longer in Uncle Sam’s uniform, Jerry’s
next thought was of getting something to eat.</p>

<p>“And I only wish old Bob and Ned were here
with me to help get up a meal—provided I can
find any!” mused the lad. “Wonder what happened
to them. Were they tossed overboard as
I was? Or did the <i>Sherman</i> sink? That can
hardly have happened, though, or I’d have heard
more of a commotion—fellows shouting and so
on. Guess she’s all right, but it’s mighty queer
I’m the only one on board here. What became of
Professor Snodgrass? And what was he doing
on board, and that other queer duck—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>?”</p>

<p>Jerry paused to reflect a moment, going hastily
over in his mind all that had happened since he
had been standing in the fog on the deck of the
transport conversing with his friends.</p>

<p>“Seems like a week ago, and yet it wasn’t more
than two hours,” he decided. “Well, now for
the grub—if there is any!”</p>

<p>Jerry did not need to be told the location of the
galley and pantry. He found the place where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
ship’s food was prepared, but, like the cabins, the
deck, and the engine room—it was drearily empty.
There was a stock of dry wood and some coal
near the galley stove, however, and finding
matches in a tin box, Jerry soon had a blaze.</p>

<p>“Feels mighty good, too,” he decided as he
rubbed his hands over the fast-warming stove.
“Now if I can get something to eat I’ll feel like a
real passenger.”</p>

<p>There was, as the lad soon discovered, enough
food on board to last a long while. Much had
been hastily taken away—that was evident—but
plenty remained.</p>

<p>Whether the passengers and crew had filled the
boats before leaving what they believed to be a
sinking ship, or whether the Germans had looted
the <i>Altaire</i>, Jerry could not determine.</p>

<p>However, he found some tins of pilot biscuit,
some canned bacon, and enough coffee to last him
a year, he thought. There was condensed milk,
also, and plenty of sugar, though how the Germans
overlooked that—providing they had been
the marauders—it was hard to say.</p>

<p>Moving quickly about, Jerry soon had some
bacon sizzling on the stove, its aroma mingling
with that of the coffee. Having unearthed a tin
of preserved butter, Jerry set himself a table.
Then, surveying the work of his hands, he exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not half bad, old top! Not half bad!”</p>

<p>How good that sizzling, crisp bacon and coffee
tasted to Jerry Hopkins! He was just finishing
his repast and wondering what he had best do
next, when he heard a sound up above on deck.</p>

<p>Jerry started so suddenly that he dropped the
empty coffee cup he had been about to set down,
and it crashed to the floor, breaking into many
pieces.</p>

<p>“Are we hitting something else, or has some
one come to life on board here?” mused Jerry,
as he slowly rose from his seat.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>THREE ON A RAFT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Slowly, owing to its size and clumsy, though
eminently safe, construction, the life raft containing
the sailor approached the bit of wreckage that
supported Bob Baker and Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Are you all right?” the sailor called to them,
and his voice seemed happy and jolly in spite of
his situation.</p>

<p>“As right as can be,” responded Bob. “We’ll
be better when we get on board with you, though.
That is, if there’s room.”</p>

<p>“Sure, there’s plenty of room!” the old salt asserted.
“And there’s stuff to eat and drink here,
though I haven’t time to get at it. Steady now,
and I’ll have you on board in another minute or
two.”</p>

<p>He navigated his queer craft until he had
brought it alongside the mass of wreckage, and in
a few minutes more, Bob and the professor were
safely on board. The change was a most welcome
one, since the life raft rode high in the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and they could sit out of reach of the waves, at
least while the sea was calm. In a storm it would
be another matter, but they did not think of this
just then.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll paddle away from that bit of jagged
timber,” said the sailor. “It won’t do to get
rammed with that, or we may get a hole stove in
one of our air tanks. That’d be bad!”</p>

<p>He was about to fend off the rude craft that had
saved the lives of Bob and Professor Snodgrass
when the latter uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” he begged. “My clothes!
I’ve got a pencil in one pocket, and some paper.
After I dry it out I can make notes on this new
kind of crab I’ve found in this seaweed. I want
to get my clothes.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be a bad idea,” decided Bob. “I’ll
get mine, too. May have a chance to use ’em later
on.”</p>

<p>It did not take long to haul aboard the raft the
bundles of wet clothing from the cracks in the
mass of wreckage, and then Bob, taking an oar,
helped the sailor shove off.</p>

<p>“Now we’re properly afloat, we’d better think
what we’re going to do,” suggested the old salt.
“I’m no navigator. Beno Judd is my name, and
I generally write ‘A. B.’ after it when I sign papers.
Can either of you gentlemen navigate?”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” confessed Bob, as he told his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
name and that of his scientific friend. “Perhaps
the professor may be able to help us.”</p>

<p>“Help you do what?” asked Professor Snodgrass,
looking up from his occupation of investigating
the seaweed.</p>

<p>“Navigate,” answered Bob. “Mr. Judd, this
sailor, says he doesn’t know anything about it.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” admitted the professor. “But
why do we want to navigate? We’re afloat, aren’t
we? And we’re comparatively dry now, or will
be soon. This bunch of seaweed will keep me occupied
for several days, and——”</p>

<p>He paused to look closely at the sailor.</p>

<p>“What did you do with it?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“With what?”</p>

<p>“That bug.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe the poor thing died of fright, or
was drowned, sir,” was the answer, given with
just the trace of a smile. “I went overboard when
you did, sir, and that’s all I know.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” mused the professor. “But perhaps
sometime I may find another on you. At any
rate I have this crab, and a most beautiful specimen
it is.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he held up a squirming creature,
which, as Bob said later, never would have taken
a prize, even at a bulldog show.</p>

<p>“I hope to secure some valuable data from this
specimen as to the possible effect of the discharge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of depth bombs on inhabitants of the sea,” the
professor went on. “If I only had some dry note
paper!” he sighed, as he took a sodden mass from
his wet garments.</p>

<p>“You’re lucky to be as high and as dry as you
are, sir!” exclaimed the sailor Judd. “I count myself
lucky to have met with this raft. All I had, at
first, was a bit of wood hardly enough to kindle a
fire. This is much better.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is fine,” agreed the professor.</p>

<p>“Speaking of fires,” ventured Bob, “did you say
there was something to eat on board?” and he
looked suggestively at the closed box which
formed the highest part of the life raft.</p>

<p>“This is supposed to contain food and water,”
remarked Judd, as he tapped the compartment in
question. “Shall I open it?”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” exclaimed the stout lad.
“Even a cold snack would taste good.”</p>

<p>“And possibly we might find some dry paper
in there on which I could make a few notes.” The
professor spoke wistfully. “I have the pencil,”
he added, as he drew one from his wet and sodden
garments.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see,” said the sailor. “There’s no
need of rowing just now,” he added to Bob, who
had one of the oars in his hands. “We aren’t in
any danger of running into any one or of getting
anywhere, either. We can see what we’ve got to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
eat and then start to navigate—that is, we can
row and see where we get.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we ought to see if we can
find the <i>Sherman</i>?” asked Bob. “She ought to be
somewhere around here,” and he gazed into the
fog that still surrounded them.</p>

<p>“Not much use trying,” declared the sailor.
“I shouted until my throat ached, and never a
word in answer did I get. I don’t know what
happened to the transport after I left it, but I
couldn’t get sight of her.”</p>

<p>He turned to open the case that was placed
amidships of the life raft. It was tightly closed
by a catch that could be easily opened when one
knew how, and Judd seemed to know.</p>

<p>“Is this life raft from the <i>Sherman</i>?” asked
Bob. “Did they throw it over when the crash
came?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t one from the transport,” the sailor
answered. “It’s like some we carried, though.
This one is from the steamer <i>Altaire</i>, and I
shouldn’t wonder but what that was the derelict
that crashed into us.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Altaire</i>!” murmured Bob. “I wonder if
we’ll ever see her again. I’ve always wanted to
see a derelict.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d rather see one at a distance, if they’re
going to act as this one did,” remarked Professor
Snodgrass. “Though I suppose I shouldn’t find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
fault, as I might never have discovered this crab
if I had not gone overboard. The only thing that
worries me, though, is that I didn’t get that sea-leech.
That’s what was on you,” he added to the
sailor. “A sea-leech is one of the rarest specimens
of the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hirudo</i>, and this was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hirudo
aqua marinis</i>, quite different from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hirudo
medicinalis</i>. What I was particularly interested in
was to observe whether the sea-leech had the same
three small white teeth with serrated edges which
cause the peculiar triradiated wound as has the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hirudo medicinalis</i>.”</p>

<p>Judd stared in amazement.</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s all the same to you,” said Bob,
with a smile, “I’d like to try my teeth on some
of the food in that box.”</p>

<p>“All right, my boy! I’m with you!” agreed the
professor. “I feel a bit hungry myself.”</p>

<p>Judd opened the locker, and to the delight of
the three on the raft it was well filled. There was
preserved food enough to last them perhaps a
week, and a large cask of fresh water—that is, it
was comparatively fresh, for no one could say
how long the raft had been adrift.</p>

<p>“But it can’t have been long,” asserted the old
salt. “My opinion is that the life raft was jarred
off the derelict when she hit us. Otherwise it
wouldn’t have been floating in the place where we
struck the water. Besides, there isn’t any growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
or mass of seaweed and barnacles on it as there
would be if it had been long in the water.”</p>

<p>“Well, we ought to be thankful for what we
have,” said Bob, with a sigh, as he munched some
sea biscuit and a bit of corned beef, a can of which
the sailor opened. “This is a good deal better off
than I thought we’d be a while back. How about
it, Professor Snodgrass?”</p>

<p>“You are right,” was the answer from the little
scientist. “And, Bob, don’t destroy any wrapping
paper. I can use the blank side for making notes.”</p>

<p>This he proceeded to do, taking the crab as his
first specimen, though he declared that the bunch
of seaweed, which he had laid aside, contained
much else that would hold his attention later.</p>

<p>“Well, now let’s consider what’s best to do,”
said Bob, when they had made a fairly substantial
meal, washing it down with the water which,
though not exactly as good as that from a faucet
or a well, was very acceptable.</p>

<p>“Which way shall we row?” asked the sailor.
“If you gentlemen will tell me how to navigate
I’ll be only too willing.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my share of rowing,” agreed Bob.
“But that’s the question—which way shall we
row?”</p>

<p>“Or sail,” added Judd.</p>

<p>“Sail!” exclaimed the stout lad. “Can we
sail?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there’s a small mast and sail here,”
and the seaman pointed out where it was fastened
to the raft. “We can hoist the sail, but there’s no
wind to fill it.”</p>

<p>This was true enough. The fog still enveloped
them, and it needed a wind to carry away this concealing
vapor. It hid them from view even as it
hid from them the possible location of the <i>Sherman</i>
and the derelict.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s hoist the sail, anyhow,” suggested
Bob. “Then it will be ready when the wind does
come, and if there are any small boats cruising
around looking for us, or if any other ships get
in this neighborhood, they can see us more easily
if we have the sail up.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” agreed the sailor. “Up she
goes.”</p>

<p>As has been remarked, the raft, on which the
three now were, consisted of two large hollow
steel cylinders. Between them was a raised
framework, and this, in addition to holding the
box of food, contained a compartment for the oars
and for a small sail. The mast for the latter was
soon stepped in the hole provided for it. It was
braced by ropes, and the sail hoisted.</p>

<p>“Now we’re all ready for a voyage!” cried
Bob, more gaily than he could have talked an hour
before.</p>

<p>For some little time they drifted on, the sail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
hanging idly at the mast, and the fog lazily swirling
around them. Then, suddenly, there came a
puff of wind. They all felt it at once.</p>

<p>“A breeze!” cried the sailor.</p>

<p>“Yes, and look!” cried Bob. “There’s the
<i>Sherman</i>!”</p>

<p>He pointed to what seemed an opening torn in
the veil of fog, and all three had a glimpse of the
camouflaged side of some vessel. Then, as the
wind bellied out the sail, the fog shut in again, and
it was as if a blank, white wall confronted them.</p>

<small>REUNITED</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry Hopkins, disturbed at his lonely meal by
the sound of something or some one moving on the
deck of the derelict, started slowly and cautiously
toward the companionway.</p>

<p>“If it’s one of the crew of this ship or some of
the passengers, I’ll be all right,” he reasoned.
“But if it’s one of some beastly German submarine
crew——”</p>

<p>He did not finish, but looked around for some
sort of weapon. He saw a small bar of iron,
which might have been used by the cook for a
fire poker, and with this in his hand Jerry cautiously
went up on deck.</p>

<p>“Anybody here?” he called, as he carefully
thrust up his head. He held the iron bar in readiness.
There was no answer, and as Jerry felt the
cold, clammy air on his face and smelled the fog,
he knew that the derelict was still enveloped in
the mist.</p>

<p>“No one seems to have boarded me,” he mused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
as his eyes searched the whiteness for a glimpse
of some other craft. “If any one is here besides
myself he must have been in hiding. Hello!” he
cried as loudly as he could. “Anybody at home?”</p>

<p>There was no answer. There was only the
swish and swash of the heaving ocean against the
sides of the derelict and the rattle and bang of
some loose gear, as a swell gently careened her
to and fro.</p>

<p>“Nobody here,” mused Jerry. “What could
that noise have been?”</p>

<p>He looked about, at first warily, for he half expected
to have to engage with some German, as
he and his chums had engaged in the trenches in
France. Then he became convinced that he was
all alone on the craft, and, though he had a realization
that this would react dreadfully on him
later, for the time being he was thankful that there
was no one with whom to contend.</p>

<p>“I wonder what made that noise,” said Jerry
again, and he spoke aloud. The words had
scarcely left his lips before he heard a banging,
rattling sound, and then he saw what it was.</p>

<p>A loose keg, probably one used for water, was
rolling about the deck, and this, colliding with various
objects, movable and stationary, had caused
the commotion.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a good thing to know what it was,”
mused Jerry with an air of relief. “I’ll just make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
this fast now, so it won’t wake me up when I get
to sleep.”</p>

<p>This done, his next thought was on the very
subject he had last mentioned—going to sleep.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be a bad plan to look to see where
I’m going to bunk to-night,” mused Jerry. “I’ve
got to turn in some time, and it must be getting on
toward night—though one wouldn’t know just
what time it was in this fog.”</p>

<p>He looked at his wrist watch. It was one enclosed
in a waterproof case, and the hands showed
four o’clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>“I’ll consider that what I just ate was my lunch,”
decided Jerry, “and when the time comes I’ll have
a late supper. Wish Chunky and Ned were here
to share it with me—also the professor. Wonder
what happened to them.”</p>

<p>It was a useless wondering, and Jerry realized
it, but he could not help speculating on what fate
had befallen his companions. They had been
standing so near him when the crash came that
there was hardly any question in Jerry’s mind but
what they had either gone overboard, as had he,
or been hurt.</p>

<p>“If they fell into the sea and managed to cling
to something, maybe there’s a chance for them,”
he reflected. “But if they were right in the path
of the collision, it may be all up with them. This
certainly was a disastrous voyage from the start.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
But I suppose I ought to be thankful that I’m
alive.”</p>

<p>Carrying out his intention of finding a place to
sleep, Jerry went below again. He found he had
quite a choice open to him. There were a number
of cabins and comfortable beds he could pick
from, and though some of the bed clothing had
been taken, or at least had disappeared, there was
more than he needed.</p>

<p>He made himself up a berth in what he decided
was the captain’s cabin, though all papers and
everything else to indicate specific ownership had
been removed. Jerry hung up his own wet clothes
to dry, as he intended donning his uniform as soon
as it was in shape to wear.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been discharged yet,” he reasoned;
“and if any of the dirty Germans show up I want
to show ’em who I am!”</p>

<p>Having made up his berth, Jerry laid out some
food he intended to cook when supper time came,
and then, having banked the fire in the galley
stove, he went up on deck again. The fog was still
heavy, and he could see not much further than
the width of the deck of the derelict. But he felt
that this was a good opportunity for making an
investigation of the craft, to decide, if possible,
what character of ship she had been.</p>

<p>With his knowledge of vessels it did not take
Jerry long to make up his mind that the <i>Altaire</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
had been a tramp freighter, engaged in whatever
trade she could pick up. He did not investigate
the cargo holds, but they seemed partly filled with
boxes and cases. Some had been broken out and
carried bodily away. Others were strewn about
below decks, the contents, partly removed, of a
few giving evidence that goods of iron, steel, rubber,
clothing, farm implements, and household appliances
had made up the manifest.</p>

<p>“I guess the Germans wish they could have
taken the whole cargo,” mused Jerry, as he looked
at the broken cases. “Their subs are limited, however.
Well, if I could get this ship and her cargo
to some port I could make a lot of money.”</p>

<p>That was impossible, as he knew, unaided as
he was. His next care was to make as thorough
an inspection of the craft as was possible, and this
revealed the important fact that she was not leaking
or sinking.</p>

<p>“If the Germans thought they put her out of
business they made a mistake,” Jerry decided.
“Unless they left her with time bombs aboard,
which haven’t gone off yet.”</p>

<p>This thought gave him a fright, and he looked
as carefully as he could in what he thought the
most likely places to find such fiendish devices. He
saw nothing alarming, however.</p>

<p>The engine room was in confusion, and certain
parts of the machinery were broken. But whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
these were vital parts Jerry did not stop to determine.
He knew that without help he could not
hope to operate the engines anyhow; and without
a boiler room gang to get up steam, even the most
perfect engine would not run for the best expert in
existence.</p>

<p>“I might hoist some sort of sail,” mused the
lone navigator. “I suppose I can do that. And I
ought to set some sort of signal. This fog can’t
last forever, and if any ship passes me I want
those on board to know I’m in need of help. I’ll
go up and see what I can manage.”</p>

<p>Jerry knew there were certain signals that would
indicate a vessel in distress, while others would
show the craft was merely unmanageable. He
came under both headings, so to speak.</p>

<p>By rummaging in the chart room the lad found
a signal book, and also a set of flags and some
lanterns. These last had oil in them and were
ready for lighting.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ll do!” decided Jerry. “I’ll
hoist the flags for day work, and use the lanterns
at night. Might as well get the best I can out
of it.”</p>

<p>Finding the proper combination of flags to indicate
that he was both in distress and unmanageable,
Jerry hoisted them as high as he could on
the wireless masts.</p>

<p>“I’d send out a call for help if I could get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
electrical machinery to working,” said Jerry, as he
looked into the wireless room. But he saw that
there had been a destructive force engaged here,
for some of the instruments were smashed. He
knew how to operate a simple sending set, and also
how to receive messages, but he reasoned that it
was out of the question to make this apparatus
available.</p>

<p>“The Huns must have set off a bomb here to
prevent the <i>Altaire</i> signaling for help,” he reasoned.</p>

<p>Having hoisted his signals, Jerry began to look
about for the material for getting sail on his craft.
There was plenty of canvas, and he knew enough
about a boat to feel sure he could get up some
kind of surface that the wind might get hold of.</p>

<p>“It will give her steerage way, anyhow,” he
reasoned, “and I’ll need that if the wind begins to
blow and the old craft falls into the trough. Got
to keep her head up to the waves or I’ll be
swamped. If a sail won’t do it, I’ll have to rig up
a sea anchor.”</p>

<p>This is merely a drag, fastened to the stern of
a disabled ship by means of ropes. A sea anchor
floats just submerged under the surface, and, offering
no surface to the wind while the higher
structure of a vessel acts almost as a sail, the anchor
becomes a sort of auxiliary rudder in cases
where there is not momentum enough for the regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
rudder to be effective, or where it is missing.</p>

<p>Jerry found what he thought would make a
sail, and he was considering how he could best use
this when he noticed that there was a puff of wind.
As this had been the first in some days it attracted
his attention.</p>

<p>“It’s coming on to blow!” exclaimed the lad.
“Good! That will clear away the fog and I
can see where I am. Maybe I can sight the
<i>Sherman</i>!”</p>

<p>It was this same puff of wind that brought hope
to the hearts of Bob, the professor, and Judd
aboard the life raft.</p>

<p>“What did you think you saw?” asked the sailor,
as Bob uttered his exclamation at the sight of
something through a rift in the fog.</p>

<p>“<a href="#image04">I saw a ship!</a> A ship with camouflaged sides!”
<a href="#image04">exclaimed the stout lad</a>. “It’s the <i>Sherman</i>!
<a href="#image04">Right ahead there!</a> Look! There where the fog
is breaking again!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_172">“I SAW A SHIP!” EXCLAIMED THE STOUT LAD. “RIGHT
AHEAD THERE!”</a></div>
</div>

<p>Even Professor Snodgrass looked. For a moment
after Bob had first spoken the fog had closed
in, shutting out the momentary view he had had.
Now the wind freshened, the fog blew away, and
he pointed at what he had seen.</p>

<p>“It is a ship!” exclaimed the professor.</p>

<p>“But not the <i>Sherman</i>!” cried Judd. “That’s
an abandoned vessel! The derelict, I do believe,
that crashed into us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ahoy there! Ahoy the derelict!” shouted
Bob, standing up and waving his arms.</p>

<p>The fog rapidly blew away. The wind caught
the sail on the life raft, and the mass moved forward.
Judd quickly thrust an oar through a staple
at the stern made for the purpose, and began to
steer. They approached the strange, silent vessel
that now loomed in front of them.</p>

<p>“It is a derelict,” said Bob in a low voice.
“There isn’t a soul on board.”</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer they approached. Bob and
the sailor joined their voices in a shout.</p>

<p>“It’s just possible some one may be there,” said
the stout lad.</p>

<p>They were near enough now to look across the
broken rails—to note the damage done to the
craft. And then, as they shouted again, they saw
a figure running along the deck.</p>

<p>“Some one is there! Some one is there!” cried
Bob, greatly excited.</p>

<p>“Ahoy! Ahoy!” shouted the sailor.</p>

<p>“Now I shall be able to get some paper for my
crab notes,” murmured the professor.</p>

<p>The figure on the derelict leaned over the side
and waved a frantic welcome.</p>

<p>“Bob! Professor!” a voice shouted.</p>

<p>“Why—why—he knows us!” gasped the stout
lad. “Who can it be?”</p>

<p>A moment later the mist completely cleared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
away and the setting sun shone clearly. Bob saw
who was aboard the derelict and cried in delight.</p>

<p>“Jerry! Jerry boy! It’s Jerry Hopkins! Oh,
what luck!”</p>

<p>And a moment later the life raft grated gently
against the side of the <i>Altaire</i>. The refugees
were reunited.</p>

<small>NED AND PEPPER-POT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“There are three passengers, sir, and one
sailor, for whom we are unable to account.”</p>

<p>The chief officer was thus reporting to Captain
Munson of the transport <i>Sherman</i>, and Ned,
standing near, disheartened and with his mind
torn by cruel worries, overheard.</p>

<p>“Who are the missing ones?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“Two soldiers, Bob Baker and Jerry Hopkins;
Professor Uriah Snodgrass; and Beno Judd, a
first-class seaman. They can not be found, they
are not among the injured, nor are their bodies
among the dead. I have put them down as missing,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Quite right. Unfortunate, but quite right.
Have the boats been able to pick up any one?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, there is not much use, I believe, in keeping
them out longer in this fog. Some of them
may get lost. Call them back, but station lookouts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
with orders to report at once anything that
looks like floating wreckage to which a person
might cling. If this fog would only lift we might
have a chance of picking them up, if they, by any
chance, are still alive. Have a sufficient number
of lookouts stationed, Mr. Bangs.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Ned felt sick at heart. It was all over, then—the
happy companionship of years—he thought.
Never again would he see his beloved comrades,
Jerry and Bob, comrades with whom he had
passed the gates of death in many a battle. Professor
Snodgrass, also—that dear but eccentric individual—he,
too, was gone.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there anything we can do?” asked Ned
of the captain.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to say I don’t see what else can be
done,” was the sympathetic answer, for the commander
of the ship knew something of the love
and friendship existing between the lad who was
left and those who were gone. “You know how
the accident happened, my lad, and we have
searched all over in this vicinity. It would be
risking other lives to search farther, for it is easy
for a small boat to be lost in a fog. If it should
lift I would order them out again. I am sorry.”</p>

<p>Ned turned away, his heart heavy. To whom
could he go for solace? He had many friends
and acquaintances among his fellow soldiers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the officers were fond of him and his chums. But
Ned did not feel like talking to any of them just
now. He wanted to be alone. But solitude was
difficult to come at on the crowded ship.</p>

<p>Idly he made his way back to the scene of the
accident. The break in the bulwarks and rail had
been temporarily mended, and a curious crowd
was gathered about the hole torn in the side of
the <i>Sherman</i>. Ned did not want to stay there.</p>

<p>He looked out into the mist. The wet particles
clung to his face like tiny tears, and he had much
ado to keep back his sobs as he thought of those
who had so lately been with him.</p>

<p>“If only the fog would lift!” murmured Ned,
as he turned away from the broken place with a
shiver.</p>

<p>But the white curtain of vapor still swirled
about the troopship, seemingly moved more by the
mysterious ocean currents than by any wind. It
was still a dead calm, and though the fog may
have lifted over some parts of the ocean area
that it had covered, in the vicinity of the transport
it was still heavy and impenetrable.</p>

<p>“It seems to shut me in like a prison!” murmured
Ned.</p>

<p>Night was coming on, and it seemed to settle
down earlier than it needed to, caused by the murkiness
of the air. The first call to the supper mess
was sounded, but Ned did not respond. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
no appetite for food. There would be time enough
later to eat, if he felt so disposed.</p>

<p>“Poor Chunky!” he mused. “I’d never poke
fun at him again about his appetite if he were
here now.”</p>

<p>Ned choked back a sob and turned to go toward
the bow of the ship.</p>

<p>The deck along which he was then progressing
was more deserted then than it had been for some
time, for many of the soldiers were down below,
eating. And as Ned made his way along he saw,
coming toward him, a figure that caused him a
start, it was so like that of Professor Snodgrass.
But he knew in an instant who it was.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le cochon!</i>” he murmured.</p>

<p>Hardly knowing why he did it, Ned stepped
beneath an overhanging part of the deck, and so
was partially hidden. The man who so resembled
Professor Snodgrass—the man who had acted so
violently in the restaurant—walked toward the
place where the derelict had crashed into the <i>Sherman</i>
and stood looking at the damaged place.
Ned, from his vantage place, could observe and
hear.</p>

<p>“So this is the place, is it!” murmured <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
cochon</i>, or the pepper-pot, as Ned sometimes
thought of him. “Well, well! I am sorry for
him—for all of them. I shall have to redouble
my efforts now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned started. What did the words mean?
What was the mystery connected with this strange
man who seemed to be under guard at times, and
free to rove about at others? What association
had he with Professor Snodgrass, and why was
he so vindictive toward that little scientist? And,
now that the professor was gone, why had this man
come to gloat over the place of his disappearance?</p>

<p>All these thoughts rushed through Ned’s mind,
which was in a tumult. And then, as the little
man spoke, another idea obtruded itself.</p>

<p>What did he mean when he said:</p>

<p>“I shall have to redouble my efforts now!”</p>

<p>To Ned, obsessed as he was with a feeling of
enmity against this man, the words had but one
meaning.</p>

<p>“He means to go on with his deadly work!”
mused the lad. “He was responsible for the damage
to the ship in the first place—he caused her to
be disabled and held up in the fog. If it wasn’t
for that we’d be on our way now, and the derelict
wouldn’t have crashed into us.</p>

<p>“This man is responsible for that, though he
may not have known about the derelict. He is
responsible for the death of Bob, Jerry and Professor
Snodgrass. And now he talks of redoubling
his efforts! I know what that means! He’s a
German spy and he’s going to try to sink the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
shipload of us. He must have gotten away from
his guards. I’m going to tell the captain!”</p>

<p>Ned stepped from his place of concealment and
was about to hurry to summon some of the ship’s
officers when the little man caught sight of him.
To Ned it seemed that the pepper-pot was startled
and alarmed. He stared at Ned and stammered:</p>

<p>“Oh, you—you are here, are you?”</p>

<p>“Very much so!” was the indignant answer.
“But you won’t be here long to go on with your
dirty work. I know all about you! I know——”</p>

<p>Like a flash, and taking the youth by surprise,
the little man rushed at Ned and in a moment had
him in a grip that rendered the lad helpless. Both
wrists were held in a muscular vise that spoke volumes
for the athletic training of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>.</p>

<p>“Be quiet!” The man fairly hissed the words
into Ned’s ears. “Don’t say another word!” and
he began to drag Ned along.</p>

<small>MAKING THE BEST OF IT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When Jerry Hopkins looked over the side of
the derelict <i>Altaire</i>, and saw, slowly rising and
falling on the swell, the life raft containing Bob,
Professor Snodgrass, and the sailor, Judd, and
when the lone navigator heard the welcome greetings
in response to his own shouts, he was filled
with delight.</p>

<p>“Jerry! Jerry!” cried Bob. “Throw us a
line!”</p>

<p>“And some sort of basket or bag!” added Professor
Snodgrass. “I don’t want to lose my seaweed.
There are yet several valuable specimens
of marine life in it that I haven’t had a chance to
examine.”</p>

<p>He was as calm and collected as though he had
just been out in a small boat on some specimen-hunting
expedition and was now returning. Instead
he had been saved from death only by a
narrow margin, and even now he was far from a
dignified figure in his undergarments, a condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of attire in which Bob shared. Judd, having been
more simply clothed at the start, had kept on his
own soaked garments, which were of light texture.</p>

<p>“Is it really you?” cried Jerry in delight. “Are
you all right? Where’s Ned?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he with you?” inquired Bob, with a sinking
heart.</p>

<p>“No, I’m all alone on board. Oh, but I’m glad
to see you! But where is Ned?”</p>

<p>“He must still be on the <i>Sherman</i>,” Bob answered,
after a moment of hesitation. “We were
thrown into the sea.”</p>

<p>“So was I,” said Jerry. “And I floated around
until I found this ship. She seems sound. Did
you see anything more of the transport? Did she
sink, or what?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know,” Bob answered, while the professor
busied himself in making a compact mass
of the bunch of seaweed and Judd held the raft
as close as possible to the derelict by using one oar
as a scull.</p>

<p>“Come on up!” called Jerry. “Wait! I’ll
throw you a line. There’s one on the other side
that I climbed up by, but I can toss you another.
There are plenty of loose ends here. This ship
was deserted in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Bob and the sailor soon scrambled up on deck
by means of the cable Jerry dropped down to
them. And, after a warm hand clasp between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
two Motor Boys, and a look that meant much, they
turned their attention to getting Professor Snodgrass
on board.</p>

<p>The little scientist was not able to climb the
rope hand over hand as Bob and the sailor had
done, but he was soon hauled up to the deck by the
three, clasping his precious seaweed in his arms.</p>

<p>Judd had taken the precaution to make the line
that Jerry sent down fast to the life raft, and,
once the greetings were over, the old salt slid down
again, and fastened the clothes of Bob and the
professor to a small rope. The garments were
hauled up and hung out to dry in the air which
was fast clearing.</p>

<p>“You can put on other clothes in the meanwhile,”
said Jerry. “There’s quite a supply to
choose from. Enough for the sailor, too. Now
tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>“The sailor seems to be calling you,” interrupted
Professor Snodgrass, who had spread his
seaweed out on deck and was gleefully preparing
to examine it more closely.</p>

<p>“Ahoy up there!” shouted Judd from where he
stood on the life raft.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Better pull this craft around to the stern and
make her fast there,” was the answer. “We
might need her again.”</p>

<p>Once more the sailor scrambled up on deck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
after having made more secure the rope that attached
the life raft to the derelict. Then with his
aid, and that of Professor Snodgrass, for the task
was not easy, the raft was hauled around to the
stern and fastened there. It rode buoyantly.</p>

<p>“We can use her as a sea anchor by weighting
her,” the sailor said, “and we may have to if it
comes on to blow. Well, you’re pretty well off
here—that is, if you have anything to eat,” he observed
to Jerry, as he looked about. “If you
haven’t——”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Germans, or whoever looted this vessel,
left plenty,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better hoist up our provision box
from the raft,” suggested Bob. “No use wasting
the stuff there, and if we have to get aboard the
queer boat again we can take the stuff with us.”</p>

<p>This was considered a wise proceeding, and accordingly
the water-tight box of emergency rations
and water was hoisted up. The food in it would
not really be needed as long as the supply on the
derelict lasted, but they all felt it was best not to
take any chances.</p>

<p>“Now get on some dry clothes, and then we’ll
have a talk,” suggested Jerry. “But, first of all,
what do you really think about Ned?” and he
looked anxiously at Bob.</p>

<p>“I think he’s still on the <i>Sherman</i>,” was the
answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you really?” the tall lad demanded.</p>

<p>“I really do,” and Bob tried hard to convince
himself, as well as Jerry, of this.</p>

<p>He wanted to believe this, but, in reality, he
did not know. Ned had been standing close to
Chunky when the crash came, and Bob had not
seen his chum after that. But, to his relief, Judd
came to his aid.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I saw your friend standing on deck
near the hole that was stove in us,” he said. “I
remember seeing him as I slid overboard.”</p>

<p>“Well, in case the <i>Sherman</i> isn’t in any more
danger of sinking than the <i>Altaire</i> is, I hope Ned
is on her,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Is this the <i>Altaire</i>?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s her life raft that helped save us,”
said the sailor. “Things are sure turning out
queer!”</p>

<p>Jerry led them below, and they soon all changed
to dry garments, which had the additional merit of
being warm, though not much could be said for the
fit—especially in the case of Professor Snodgrass,
whose small form was not built to fill out the
rather roomy garments of seamen.</p>

<p>But they all made the best of it, and their spirits
rose as they saw how snug and comfortable they
could be on the craft of which Jerry had been in
lone command for a while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“And, now that we feel pretty certain Ned is
all right, we can begin to take it a bit easier,”
sighed Bob. “You said you had plenty to eat,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, even for you, Chunky,” and the tall lad
smiled for the first time since the crash. “Come
on down and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>Bob’s eyes opened with pleasure when he saw
the larder. There was plenty for the four refugees
for many weeks, even though the Germans,
or perhaps the hastily departing crew and passengers,
had well supplied themselves.</p>

<p>“It isn’t too early to eat, is it?” asked Bob, as
he looked at the packages and cans of food.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you had anything since you went
overboard?” asked Jerry, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, yes, we had a snack. But——”</p>

<p>“Fall in, Chunky! No, I don’t mean exactly
that, either,” and Jerry laughed a little. “You’ve
fallen in enough for to-day, and so have I. What
I meant was ‘fall to’ and eat as much as you like.
Then we’ll decide what’s best to be done.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if the professor wants anything?”
mused Bob. “He didn’t eat much on the raft—too
much taken up with his crab.”</p>

<p>“I’ll find out,” volunteered the tall lad.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, the little scientist
declared that he could not find time to stop now
to make a meal. He had managed to get hold of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
some blank paper, and, attired in a ship’s officer’s
suit, many sizes too large for him, he was seated
on deck poking through the bunch of seaweed and
making notes of the different creatures he found.</p>

<p>“I’ll eat later,” he said. “I want to take advantage
of the daylight while it lasts.”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness we have the sun for a
change!” exclaimed Bob, as he looked around the
horizon. “The fog is gone, and I hope it doesn’t
come back. But where do you imagine the <i>Sherman</i>
is, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t the least idea,” was the answer.
“Maybe the sailor can tell us.”</p>

<p>But the seaman was as much at sea, to use an
appropriate term, as either of the boys.</p>

<p>“I’m all twisted,” he admitted. “I don’t know
which way we drifted after we were on the raft,
and I don’t even know which way the transport
drifted during the time we were fogbound. I suppose
the officers did, but I never was much on navigation.
However, we’ve got a sound bottom
under us, that’s one blessing. She isn’t taking in
any water, is she?” he asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Not as far as I can tell,” was the answer.
“She seems as sound as a dollar—one of Uncle
Sam’s dollars,” he added. “But I wish I knew
what we ought to do. Night is coming on, and it’s
possible we may sight something or some craft
sight us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Judd. “I see you have
some signals hoisted,” and he looked at the wireless
masts from which fluttered the flags Jerry had
hoisted. “They’re all right during the day, now
that the fog has lifted, but they won’t be any use
at night.”</p>

<p>“There are some lanterns,” the tall lad said.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll hoist them,” suggested the sailor.</p>

<p>Eagerly they all looked around the horizon for
a sight of the <i>Sherman</i>, or any craft that might
aid them. But the sea heaved and rolled restlessly
and void.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>NED LEARNS SOMETHING</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ned Slade felt himself being pulled along the
deck of the transport in the firm grip of a man
who, for the moment, he believed to be insane.
The quick grasp of the pepper-pot and his sudden
motion in dragging Ned along had, for the time
being, deprived the lad of his power of resistance.
But it came back to him quickly enough, and, suspecting
some sinister design on the part of his captor,
he braced himself, pulled his hands away, and
demanded:</p>

<p>“What does this mean? What are you trying
to do, anyhow? Isn’t it enough for you to have
disabled this ship, and so, indirectly, have caused
the collision, without trying anything more?”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak so loudly! Come with me! To
my cabin! I can explain everything!” hoarsely
whispered the little man, variously dubbed the pepper-pot,
from his quick, impulsive way, and “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
cochon</i>,” a name given by Marie, the restaurant
girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not much!” cried Ned. “I see your game!
You want to get rid of me as, perhaps by accident,
you got rid of Bob, Jerry, and Professor Snodgrass!”</p>

<p>“Ah! Professor Snodgrass! He—he is impossible!
A mere dabbler! A charlatan!” cried
the other, with something of his former manner.
“I alone hold the secret! I shall give it to the
world! Now that he is gone, I can work freely
and openly. I will redouble my efforts! I will
beat him!” His voice was triumphant.</p>

<p>“Yes, beat him, coward, now that he’s gone!”
cried Ned. “I don’t want to have anything to do
with you! I’m going to tell——”</p>

<p>Ned swung aside and was going to turn back to
avoid what he thought was a lunge on the part of
the strange man, a lunge that, the lad thought,
meant danger, when he collided with some one hurrying
along the passage.</p>

<p>There were many mutual grunts, for the impact
had not been a gentle one, and, half dazed, Ned
looked up to observe Captain Munson.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“What is the trouble?” asked the captain, and
he smiled at Ned and the little man—smiled in
such a way as to convince the Motor Boy that
either there was nothing wrong, or else that the
captain himself was deceived as to the character
of his passenger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is no trouble at all, Captain,” replied
the pepper-pot. “Now that my rival has gone,
I——”</p>

<p>“You mean Professor Snodgrass,” the captain
said. “Yes, unfortunately he is gone. We hope
he and the others may have saved themselves, and
perhaps have floated off on some bit of wreckage
our boats did not observe, but it hardly seems
possible. I suppose you do not need a guard any
longer?” he smilingly asked of the little man.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, my secret is in no further danger
of being taken away by an unscrupulous charlatan!”
was the emphatic answer.</p>

<p>And Ned, puzzled, observed with amazement
Captain Munson deliberately winking at him the
eye that was concealed from the pepper-pot.</p>

<p>“Captain Munson!” exclaimed Ned, “this—this
man is trying to——”</p>

<p>The pepper-pot interrupted.</p>

<p>“I can now tell everything!” he said eagerly.
“Please let me explain to him, Captain. I was
taking him to my cabin to let him understand the
whole situation, when he broke away from me
and——”</p>

<p>“If you wish to listen to Dr. Hallet’s story I am
sure you would find it interesting, to say the least,”
broke in the commander. “Of course don’t go
with him if you don’t want to, but in view of what
has taken place perhaps it will be best to let him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
tell his side of it. If you wish any further light
you may come to me. I will give orders to have
the marines withdrawn from in front of your
cabin, Dr. Hallet,” he added.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say—I mean is everything all
right? Isn’t there any danger——” began Ned.
And then as he looked at the little man, and compared
his own splendid physique with that of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>, he felt just a little bit ashamed of the
exhibition he had made. Certainly he was sure
he could hold his own in a struggle, though there
was no denying that the pepper-pot—or Dr. Hallet,
to give him his right name—had a powerful
grip.</p>

<p>“You may safely go with Dr. Hallet,” said the
captain. “I am sorry there has been any misunderstanding.
I would have explained before, but
so many things have happened, it seemed impossible.
As I say, if you are not satisfied with what
he tells you, come to me,” and having nodded to
Ned, with whom he had talked several times following
the fatal crash, the commander passed on.</p>

<p>“Now are you satisfied?” asked the little man,
and, somehow, in the light of the events of the
last few moments, his face seemed more friendly
to Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t in the least understand what it’s
all about,” admitted Ned. “You acted so queerly
in the restaurant, and then on board the transport;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and so much has happened—my friends being
missing and all that—you can’t blame me
for——”</p>

<p>“Not in the least, my dear boy! Not in the
least!” was the suave answer. “If you will come
to my cabin I can explain everything to your satisfaction.
But first let me ask: You do not seriously
believe that I caused the collision with the
derelict and the disappearance of your friends, do
you?”</p>

<p>Ned thought for a minute. Clearly he could
answer in but one way. In spite of what the captain
had said, this man might be guilty of having
caused the disablement of the <i>Sherman</i>. And so,
indirectly, he might be responsible for what happened
to her afterward. But to accuse him of
having caused Jerry, Bob, the professor and others
to fall overboard, even though such accident
was the direct result of the collision, was going a
little too far. Ned had to admit this. At least
it could not be called premeditated, for Dr. Hallet
could not have known the derelict was going to
drift past.</p>

<p>And so, after hastily thinking the matter over,
Ned came to the conclusion that he might better
accompany the little man to his cabin, and hear
what he had to say.</p>

<p>“But I’ll be on my guard,” mused Ned. “He’s
got a grip that’s hard to break. Must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
quite an athlete in his youth. But I’ve got an automatic,
and I sha’n’t hesitate to use it if I have to.”</p>

<p>Ned slipped a hand to his hip pocket where he
was carrying a small but very effective weapon he
had bought in Paris. “It might come in useful,”
he reflected.</p>

<p>“I’ll come with you,” he said to Dr. Hallet,
“but I warn you I’m not very much prepossessed
in your favor, and——”</p>

<p>“I will explain everything, my dear boy,” declared
his companion. “And then, if you wish to
hold enmity against me—— But come to my
cabin. We are likely to be disturbed here.”</p>

<p>This was true enough. Officers and soldiers
were constantly passing along the “alley” of the
ship, and Ned was kept busy saluting, while several
of his acquaintances, coming back from their
mess, looked curiously at him and his companion.</p>

<p>To the very same cabin in front of which two
marines had been on guard and within which Ned
and his chums had once seen Professor Snodgrass,
Dr. Hallet now led the Motor Boy. And it
needed but a single glance around it to disclose to
Ned one fact, at least.</p>

<p>This was that Dr. Hallet was a rival of Professor
Snodgrass—or, if not a rival, then a
scientist engaged in the same pursuits.</p>

<p>For there were the same sort of specimen boxes,
microscopes, notebooks, and other materials scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
about as always marked the abiding place
of Professor Snodgrass. There were even live
bugs crawling in cases, and Ned recognized one
or two as exactly similar to some he had helped
Professor Snodgrass catch at different times.</p>

<p>“Now if you will sit down, my boy, I’ll begin
to explain,” said Dr. Hallet. “It will take some
little time, but I am sure at the end you will have
a different feeling toward me.”</p>

<p>“I may, but I’m going to be perfectly frank, and
tell you I have my doubts!” declared Ned. “You
can start explaining whenever you are ready,” and
he let his hand swing around behind him as he took
a seat, making sure that his pistol was within ready
reach.</p>

<p>“In the first place,” began Dr. Hallet, “I want
to say that I—— Oh, I nearly forgot! I haven’t
fed my fleas!”</p>

<p>Ned nearly laughed aloud, this was so like what
Professor Snodgrass might have said. Dr. Hallet
quickly arose, and, going over to a tiny green
box, opened the top and sprinkled something in.
He then quickly closed the receptacle.</p>

<p>“Have to be sharp with fleas,” he said. “These
have bitten persons afflicted with trench fever and
mustard gas poisoning, and I am going to make
a test to see if those diseases are capable of being
transmitted by the bite of insects. I don’t want
any of these infected fleas to get on you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t want it, myself,” murmured Ned, as
he moved somewhat away from the little green
box.</p>

<p>“Well, now that I have given them food enough
to last until we land, I hope, I will go on,” resumed
the doctor. “As I was going to say, you
are much mistaken if you think that Professor
Snodgrass and I are enemies.”</p>

<p>Ned started.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said slowly, “if you are a friend of
his you take a very queer way of showing it.”</p>

<p>“Professional feeling, my dear boy! Professional
feeling; that’s all. Call it jealousy, if you
like,” said Dr. Hallet, with something like a
chuckle. “As a matter of fact, both he and I are
working along the same lines to benefit humanity,
and if I said anything harsh against him——”</p>

<p>“Which you certainly did!” interrupted Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, it was in a Pickwickian sense only—merely
Pickwickian,” and this time the doctor
laughed. “You have read Dickens, I dare say?”
he went on.</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Ned. “I know my Pickwick
Papers.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll understand. As a matter of fact,
Professor Snodgrass is my very dear friend, and
we are mutually, though perhaps in a rival manner,
seeking the same certain end.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you are,” asked Ned in amazement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
“why did you act so? Why did you call him a
‘charlatan’? And why were you put under guard?
And did you try to blow up the transport with a
bomb? If you did——”</p>

<p>Ned’s words died away, for at that moment the
<i>Sherman</i> was shaken from stem to stern by a violent
concussion, and after a period of portentous
silence confused shouting broke out all over the
ship.</p>

<p>Ned looked strangely at Dr. Hallet and drew
his automatic pistol.</p>

<p>“This isn’t so bad,” remarked Jerry Hopkins.</p>

<p>“Not half,” added Bob Baker. “That is,” he
qualified, “when you think how the professor and
Judd here and I were situated a few hours ago.”</p>

<p>“Right snug and comfortable, I calls it!” stated
the sailor.</p>

<p>As for Professor Snodgrass, attired in a warm
but ill-fitting suit which had belonged to some
member of the <i>Altaire’s</i> force, he bent over his
notes at the table in the cabin of the derelict,
where the four refugees were gathered. Night
had fallen, signal lamps had been hoisted to the
wireless mastheads, and now, having finished their
supper, Jerry and his companions were below,
“right snug and comfortable,” as the old salt
put it.</p>

<p>They had found lanterns and lighted them to
give a cheerful glow to the cabin. The electric
service was, of course, out of commission with
the engines stopped, but provision had been made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
for auxiliary oil lighting, and it was no worse than
conditions had been on all ships before the electric
light was discovered.</p>

<p>“Do you think we ought to stand watch and
watch all night?” asked Bob, looking at Jerry.
“We might sight the <i>Sherman</i> or some other vessel,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what good it would do,” replied
the tall lad. “If we did sight the <i>Sherman</i> we
couldn’t move toward her, and unless her engines
have been put in commission she couldn’t reach
us. We could only drift along and look at one
another. And I don’t believe we’ll sight the
<i>Sherman</i>.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean she’s sunk?” asked Bob in a low
voice, as he thought of Ned still, in all probability,
left on board.</p>

<p>“No, not exactly that,” Jerry answered. “She
has too many watertight compartments to sink unless
she was blown all apart, and I don’t believe
that has happened. But I think we must have
gotten into two widely separated ocean currents.
One is carrying us one way and the other is taking
the <i>Sherman</i> along.”</p>

<p>“That’s about the way of it,” chimed in Judd.</p>

<p>“But what about seeing some other vessel?”
asked Bob. “I mean one that isn’t disabled and
that could take us off.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, we might see one if we took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
turns standing watch through the night,” admitted
Jerry. “But we have our distress signal lamps set,
and any vessel sighting them will put for us at
once.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right, if you think that there’s no use
worrying,” Bob agreed. “I didn’t fancy standing
a night trick myself, but if it had to be done——”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s necessary, boys,” said Judd.
“As Jerry Hopkins says, if any vessel sees our
lights she’ll be bound to come close and investigate.”</p>

<p>The experience through which the sailor had
passed with Bob and the professor made him seem
like an old friend, and Jerry and Bob were glad
to have him call them by name, as though he had
known them many years. In fact the nearness to
a tragic end, which at one period confronted them
all, seemed to squeeze a long time into a very few
moments.</p>

<p>“Well then all we’ve got to do,” suggested Bob,
“is to stay here, sleep and eat——”</p>

<p>“You haven’t forgotten the eats, Chunky!”
laughed Jerry, and it was the first real merriment
that had enlivened them since the accident.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve got plenty in the kitchen,”
said Bob, joining in the laugh at his own failing.
“But what I meant was that we can’t really do
anything, can we, to better ourselves any?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Jerry, looking at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
sailor. “I did think of hoisting some sort of sail,
and now that you’re here maybe we can do that.
Then we ought to rig up some sort of sea anchor
to keep us head on to the waves in case of a blow.
Outside of that I don’t know that we can do
anything except to keep our distress signals
flying.”</p>

<p>“Some sort of sail would be good,” agreed
Judd; “and a sea anchor can be easy rigged up
now that we have the life raft towing astern.
There’s one trouble, though, about setting sail,
provided we can do it.”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, if we get any steerageway on the craft
at all, we may not be able to handle her.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Bob. “Her rudder is
still in place. I noticed it when we were making
fast the life raft.”</p>

<p>“Yes, her rudder is in place,” agreed the old
salt, “and it only weighs several tons. It’s made
to turn by steam, and with the engines dead there
isn’t any steam. I doubt if we could manage to
steer by hand.”</p>

<p>“There must be some provision for that,” asserted
Jerry. “The steam steering gear might go
out of commission at any time—in fact, I’ve often
read of that happening on vessels. And when it
does happen don’t they have to steer by hand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted the sailor, “I suppose they do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
We’ll have a look in the morning and see what we
can do. Just now I think we’d better all take it
easy.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” agreed Jerry. “We’ve had a hard
time. I only hope poor old Ned is as well off as
we are just now.”</p>

<p>“I fancy he’s better off in case he’s still on the
transport, as he must be,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“He will be if he doesn’t fall too much under
the influence of that nincompoop, Dr. Hallet!”
suddenly exclaimed Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>Jerry and Bob started, looked at one another,
and then at the little scientist who was busy making
notes about the queer crab and other creatures
he had found in the seaweed.</p>

<p>“Who is this Dr. Hallet?” asked Jerry. “You
spoke of him once before. Is he the little man I
had the trouble with in the restaurant, and who
tried to blow up the <i>Sherman</i>?”</p>

<p>“Blow up the troopship!” cried the professor.
“Why, I never heard of that!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you know that her engines were disabled
by an explosion?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>The professor shook his head.</p>

<p>“I didn’t pay much attention to what was going
on,” he said. “I had a lot of notes to transcribe
in my books, having made them only hastily
on scraps of paper. All I recall is that we stopped
for something or other, and I supposed we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
waiting for passengers, or for some reason like
that.”</p>

<p>“Waiting for passengers in the middle of the
ocean,” murmured Bob. Jerry signaled his chum
to refrain from making comments, and then the
tall lad fired a volley of questions at the professor.</p>

<p>“Who is this Dr. Hallet?” Jerry asked. “Why
is he such an enemy of yours? and why was he
kept under guard in his cabin? Afterward the
guard was withdrawn and we saw you in there,
though perhaps you didn’t see us. And what does
it all mean, anyhow? Why will Ned be likely to
get into trouble if he is left under the influence of
this man? Don’t you think you’d better explain?”</p>

<p>The professor appeared to be considering this.
And it seemed to require as much mental effort on
his part as though he were deciding the most
abstruse of abstract questions.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he finally admitted, “I think I had better
explain matters to you. I didn’t think you
were so interested. And as for you having trouble
with this—this—well, I won’t say what I think of
him—but as for you having had trouble with Dr.
Hallet, Jerry, I know nothing of that. I only
know I’ve had plenty of trouble.”</p>

<p>“He’s a long time getting down to facts,”
thought Bob. “I wonder what it all means?”</p>

<p>“To begin at the beginning,” resumed the professor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
after apparently casting his mind back into
the past, “the trouble between Dr. Hallet and me
started when we were rivals in the pursuit of——”</p>

<p>The silence that pervaded the cabin, save for
the low voice of the little bald-headed scientist,
was suddenly broken by a dull rumbling sound,
and a slight vibration seemed to go through the
whole length of the derelict. To the boys, used to
water navigation as they were, the sound and the
feeling meant but one thing.</p>

<p>“We’ve bumped into something or something
has bumped into us!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Or else we’ve rubbed up against the dock,”
added Jerry.</p>

<p>“No dock out here in mid-ocean!” exclaimed
the sailor. “But we sure have struck something.
Not hard though, that’s one good thing. Otherwise
we’d have a hole stove in us.”</p>

<p>“We’d better see what it is,” said Jerry, preparing
to go up on deck.</p>

<p>The others agreed with him, even Professor
Snodgrass putting away his papers and following
the two boys and the old sailor.</p>

<p>As they mounted to the deck the bumping sounds
kept up, and the tremors and vibrations continued
to be felt throughout the <i>Altaire</i>.</p>

<p>“It’s just as if we were among a lot of ice
cakes,” said Bob. “I hope we don’t ram an iceberg.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hardly that in this latitude,” said Jerry.
“Though some years they are found farther south
than others.”</p>

<p>As they emerged on the deck, coming as they
did from the lighted cabin, at first they could observe
nothing. But gradually their eyes became
accustomed to the darkness and they could see to
move about.</p>

<p>“It’s on both sides!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“And it isn’t ice, either!” added Judd. “I
know the smell of ice, and you can always feel a
chill in the air. It isn’t a big berg, that’s sure, and
small cakes wouldn’t last long in these warm
waters.”</p>

<p>“But what is it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry ran below and brought up a lantern which
had on a powerful reflector. It was a light set on
the wall in the cabin and designed to throw the
rays in one spot. It was a sort of oil-power searchlight.</p>

<p>Holding this, Jerry advanced to the rail and
directed the rays of light over the side and down
to the water. What he saw caused him to utter
a cry of surprise and fear, in which the others
joined.</p>

<p><a href="#image01">“Whales!” shouted Jerry. “We’re in the midst
of a school of whales!”</a></p>

<p>“You’re right!” agreed the sailor. “We’ve
run right into them, or they’ve surrounded us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and it’s the bumping of their big heads against the
sides that made the sounds.”</p>

<p>“Is there any danger?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“There may be, if they take a notion to ram us
all at once,” the sailor said. “Of course there
isn’t the same danger to a ship like this that there
would be to a small boat. But if they start to
ram, and loosen some of the side plates below the
water line so that we begin to leak—well, there’s
no way of pumping the sea out.”</p>

<p>“Whales?” exclaimed Professor Snodgrass.
“How interesting! I wish Dr. Hallet were here
now!”</p>

<p>He did not specify whether it was so that the
doctor might view the natural phenomenon or so
that the professor’s rival might be annoyed and
distressed by the visit of the sea monsters.</p>

<p>“What had we better do?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Do? Why don’t do anything!” said Jerry.
“If we let ’em alone they may swim off, just as
they swam up.”</p>

<p>As he spoke there came a more violent concussion
to the vessel, and she seemed to heel over
slightly.</p>

<p>“That was an old residenter who rammed us!”
exclaimed Bob. “A few more blows like that,
and we’ll start to leaking. If we only had a hand
grenade or two or a bomb gun! Look, they’re
clustering thicker than ever right in front of us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, by the rays of the lamp the sea was observed
to be churned to foam by the milling of
the huge creatures.</p>

<p>Again came a fearful blow on the ship’s quarter,
and then Jerry cried:</p>

<p>“The bow gun! The bow gun! We can train
that on ’em and shoot! That’s the way to get rid
of the whales! Use the bow gun!”</p>

<small>LEAKING</small></h2>

<p>Dr. Hallet smiled as he saw the sinister
weapon in Ned’s hand. The lad did not aim at
his companion, and, as a matter of fact, he had
drawn the pistol more from instinct than anything
else. The sudden noise, coupled with what he had
gone through, had put Ned on the same sort of defensive
attitude as he had been constantly under
while in the trenches or on the battlefield.</p>

<p>“There is no need for that,” said the scientist.
“I see you do not trust me.”</p>

<p>Ned would have blushed except for the fact
that he was almost as brown as an Indian; and
whoever heard of an Indian blushing?</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon!” exclaimed the lad. “I—I
really didn’t think what I was doing. But did
you hear that noise?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard something. There is some excitement
up above.”</p>

<p>There was no question about that. The shouting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and the tumult up above continued to increase,
and it was evident that something serious had happened.
There had been no concussion such as
had taken place when the derelict hit the <i>Sherman</i>,
but that there was danger was evident even to the
scientist, who, like Professor Snodgrass, was absent-minded
and let the ordinary affairs of life
pass by unheeded.</p>

<p>“We had better go up and see what it is,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, I agree with you,” was the answer. “My
explanations will keep for a while.”</p>

<p>Ned was of the same mind, and, putting away
his weapon, he and his companion hastened out
of the latter’s cabin. In the passageway leading
to the main deck they encountered many sailors,
marines, soldiers and officers hurrying along.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What’s happened now?”
called Ned to some whom he knew.</p>

<p>“Don’t know! Another explosion, I guess!”
some one answered.</p>

<p>“They’ve signaled to abandon ship!” cried another.
“We’ve got to take to the boats!”</p>

<p>With an exclamation Dr. Hallet turned from
Ned’s side. He swung about and was about to
retrace his steps when the lad caught him by the
arm.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Back to my cabin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“To get some of my most valuable experimental
specimens and save my notebooks. Their loss
would be irreparable.”</p>

<p>“You can’t go back!” cried Ned, and he sought
to drag his companion with him. “The ship may
go down at any minute, and if you’re caught in
your cabin you won’t have a chance!”</p>

<p>“But I must save my papers!” cried the scientist.
“They represent my life work. I would be ruined
if they were lost! If we have to take to the boats
I can save them if I have them with me. I can’t
let them go down with the ship.”</p>

<p>Ned recognized the same traits so often shown
by Professor Snodgrass under similar conditions.
The doctor was going to prove a stubborn man,
Ned could see that.</p>

<p>“Hurry up! Hurry up!” a sailor shouted as
he passed Ned and his companion on the run.
“Get to your boat stations!”</p>

<p>“Do you hear!” yelled Ned in the doctor’s ear.
“We’ve got to abandon the troopship!”</p>

<p>“I don’t go without my notes!” was the answer,
and the man sought to pull his arm away
from Ned’s detaining hand.</p>

<p>“Well, if you feel that way about it the only
thing for me to do is to help you,” muttered the
Motor Boy. “I can’t see you drown like a rat in
a trap, and you may if you don’t have help. Come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
on!” he said in no very gentle voice as he swung
around and hurried along with the doctor.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked the scientist
in some alarm.</p>

<p>“Help you gather up your notebooks and other
things. Oh, don’t be afraid!” he added, as he
saw a look of something like distrust spread itself
over the features of his companion. “I know
what’s valuable. I have often helped Professor
Snodgrass. I’ll do the best I can for you.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Thank you for that!” murmured Dr.
Hallet. “Some of my notes are worth more than
their weight in diamonds!”</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass all over again!” mused
Ned, and he was hardly able to repress a smile in
spite of the gravity of the situation.</p>

<p>And that it was grave he could not doubt as he
noted the confusion on every side and saw the
soldiers and others hurrying to the stations that
had been assigned to them in case of accident. It
had been announced before the troopship sailed
that there were enough lifeboats, rafts, and other
appliances for saving the men aboard the ship
and to provide for all in case it was necessary to
abandon the transport at sea. But Ned had his
doubts of this, as, it was evident, many others had
also. For every one was hurrying to get to a vantage
point, though there was no real disorder, and
the men were obeying their officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned, rather reluctantly it must be confessed,
followed the doctor into the cabin they had so
lately quitted. The scientist began to gather up
notebooks and papers and stuff them into his
pockets.</p>

<p>“That won’t do!” cried Ned. “If you have to
jump overboard they’ll get soaked!”</p>

<p>“But I’m not going to jump overboard!” was
the calm reply, and it was to be noted that the
doctor was now more calm than was Ned.</p>

<p>“You may have to,” was the grim response.
“Haven’t you got a bit of oiled silk, or rubber, or
something, you can wrap your papers in? That
will protect them from the sea water.”</p>

<p>“Oiled silk? Oh yes, I have something like
that,” the doctor decided, after thinking a moment.
He produced an oilcloth bag, saying:</p>

<p>“I use this to cover my specimen boxes when I
go out in the rain. Will this do?”</p>

<p>“It will have to!” exclaimed Ned, and he began
stuffing into the receptacle the papers he gathered
up from the various places where they were scattered
about the doctor’s cabin. “Lively now!”
cried the lad. “We may not have much time!”</p>

<p>“I must save all I can!” murmured the doctor.
He gathered up book after book of notes, and as
fast as he handed them to Ned the Motor Boy
stuffed them into the water-proof bag.</p>

<p>“Everybody on deck!” shouted a voice outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the cabin door. “Everybody on deck! We’ve
got to abandon ship! She’s leaking like a sieve!”</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Ned. “No time for any
more!”</p>

<p>“I must save my fleas! I must save the fleas
I’m testing as gas poisoning and trench fever carriers!”
cried Dr. Hallet, as he turned toward the
little green box. “I can’t go without them!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to!” muttered Ned, grabbing him
by the shoulders. “Didn’t you hear ’em say we
are leaking?” And by a sudden effort he succeeded
in forcing the doctor out of the cabin, not
before the scientist, however, had caught up the
specimen box containing the insects.</p>

<small>THE WIRELESS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Come on! Come on! Everybody up on
deck! Take your boat stations!” was the cry that
Ned and Dr. Hallet heard as they emerged from
the cabin.</p>

<p>“Have we got much time?” Ned asked.</p>

<p>“Not any too much!” was the grim response.
“Get to your boat station and stand by for further
orders—that’s the instructions.”</p>

<p>It was one of the junior ship’s officers who answered
Ned, and the lad ventured a further question
or two.</p>

<p>“Are we badly damaged?” he inquired. “Did
we hit something, or was it another bomb?” And
as he asked this he could not help glancing at Dr.
Hallet who stood at his side. The scientist, however,
did not seem aware of the scrutiny.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about any bombs,” was
the answer. “All I heard was that they tried to
get the machinery going down in the engine room.
A big steam pipe burst and blew a hole in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
side. We’re taking in water fast, and there aren’t
any pumps to get rid of it. There’s a chance to
save everybody, though, if they’ll do as they’re
told—get on deck and stand by to enter the boats
when the word is given.”</p>

<p>“Have I time enough to go back and get a very
valuable specimen of a field mouse I left in my
cabin?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“No!” cried Ned and the officer in such perfect
time and with the same explosive effect that it
seemed like one voice.</p>

<p>“Up on deck with you!” added the young officer.
“See that he obeys you!” he added to Ned,
as he looked significantly at the uniform of the soldier
lad. He evidently was aware of the peculiar
notions of the scientist.</p>

<p>“That settles it!” muttered Ned. “You’ll have
to come with me, Dr. Hallet. There are other
field mice.”</p>

<p>“None like this one,” was the reply. “He was
suffering from a peculiar fungus ailment and I
wanted to make a special study of it when I got
back home. Dear me! This is terrible! I was
sure I could beat Professor Snodgrass at this
game, but it seems I am fated not to.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to hear something about this game
against our professor,” muttered Ned, “but there
isn’t time now. Come on! You’re lucky to have
your papers and fleas!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Ned, he thought with regret of certain
souvenirs he, in common with Bob and Jerry, had
brought on board with them. They had been put
away in a safe place, but there was no time to get
them now.</p>

<p>And Ned had some mementoes of the Great
War that he intended giving to a certain girl back
in Cresville. Now, he reflected, they might soon
be at the bottom of the sea. Well, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est la
guerre</i>!”</p>

<p>Up on deck it seemed to be a scene of great confusion,
but, in reality, the officers, both those of
the army and the ship, under Captain Munson
of the <i>Sherman</i>, had the situation well in hand.
The confusion was seeming only, for the men were
being sent in squads to their respective boat stations.
Sailors were seeing to it that the falls of
the small craft were clear, and that life rafts were
free for launching. Others were making sure
that each boat or raft contained food and
water.</p>

<p>Of course the orders were that they should always
be in that prepared condition, but, like everything
else human, there might have been a failure.
Captain Munson, however, was trusting
nothing to chance, and at this eleventh hour no
risk was to be assumed lest some wretched refugees
might starve or die of thirst if their boat or raft
drifted away. As it was, however, all the boats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and other floating bits of sea apparatus were
found to be well stocked.</p>

<p>Life preservers and cork rings were put where
they could be instantly gotten at, and, this much
accomplished, all those who had taken their places
at the boats awaited further orders.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the war was practically
over and that all German submarines had been
recalled, it was felt that there was great danger
on the open sea from floating mines, or perhaps
a stray torpedo that might have failed to find its
mark. There was more danger, of course, to a
big moving ship in this respect, than to small boats
whose speed would be slower, and which did not
float as deeply as the drifting mines were submerged
below the surface.</p>

<p>But, even with all that potential danger, the soldiers
and sailors remained wonderfully calm and
in good cheer. They stood waiting, models of discipline
in every respect.</p>

<p>Questions flew back and forth, but no one really
knew what had happened. Ned’s information
was as good as any, and this seemed to be the most
acceptable explanation.</p>

<p>Every one knew that the engine room force had
been trying desperately ever since the disablement
of the <i>Sherman</i> to get the machinery in working
condition again. And it might well be that some
weakened steam pipe had burst with disastrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
results to the transport, if not to human life below
decks.</p>

<p>At the same time, Ned could not help thinking
that the explosion—if there had been one—might
have been caused by a bomb cunningly planted by
some German spy, or, now that the war was over
and spies were no longer needed, sympathizer.
And in that connection he must needs think of Dr.
Hallet.</p>

<p>The scientist was assigned to a boat some distance
away from Ned’s station, so the lad had no
further chance to talk to the queer little man and
hear the explanation which was promised.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he really is all right, and it is only
professional jealousy between him and Professor
Snodgrass, or if there is something more behind
it all,” mused Ned.</p>

<p>His reflections were interrupted by the passing
along of one of the ship’s officers, and at once several
questions were fired at this individual.</p>

<p>“Are we still taking in water?” was the foremost
inquiry.</p>

<p>“I am glad to say that the leak has been partly
stopped,” was the answer. “It is confined to one
compartment, and, if the bulkheads hold, we may
not have to abandon ship.”</p>

<p>“I hope, most sincerely, that we do not!” Ned
heard the voice of Dr. Hallet exclaim. “I want to
get that field mouse!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-night!” exclaimed a doughboy. “Does
he want it for his cat or himself?”</p>

<p>There was a laugh at this, and it served, in a
measure, to relieve the nervous tension.</p>

<p>Hope began to spring up in hearts which had
begun to lose it, and with small wonder, when the
series of happenings that occurred to the <i>Sherman</i>
is considered. Nothing but ill luck seemed to
have attended her since she set out.</p>

<p>And so they stood waiting at the boats, ready
to take to the small craft at the word of command
and trust themselves to the great ocean in what,
by comparison with the heaving billows, were mere
cockle-shells. But the hearts of most of them
were stout and strong.</p>

<p>Night began to settle down and a little wind
began to blow.</p>

<p>“Storm coming!” said some.</p>

<p>“It’ll blow the fog away,” cried others.</p>

<p>And then, when it was about midnight, word
was passed around that there was no immediate
danger, and that the soldiers might leave their
boat stations. But they were told to hold themselves
in readiness for another call.</p>

<p>The leak had been partly stopped, it was said,
and the engine room force was again at work trying
to get up steam, if only to operate the wireless.</p>

<p>“Let us hope that they do,” said Dr. Hallet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
who sought out Ned. “Though I would have been
able to save most of my notes, there were some
that I should have been forced to leave behind.
And I’m glad I can come back to my field mouse,”
he added, as he looked in the box in his cabin containing
the tiny creature, which was alive.</p>

<p>“If you care to,” said Ned, “I should like to
have you go on with the explanation you started
when the explosion came.” He was beginning to
have a different feeling toward his companion.
Dr. Hallet was so much like Professor Snodgrass,
that, at times, Ned had to stop and think before
using the latter’s name and title.</p>

<p>“Yes, I should like to explain,” said the scientist.
“I begin to understand how you mistrusted me,
and, as you will see, it is without cause. I may
sum it all up in a few words by saying that Professor
Snodgrass and I, though scientific rivals,
are good friends; and the only thing between us
is a sort of race to see who will be the first to discover
a certain disputed matter in relation to the
germ destroying powers of certain fungi which we
gathered in a French forest. I thought at one
time that I had the professor beaten, and I managed
to secure passage on this transport, thinking
to be the first to reach the United States and give
to the world my wonderful discovery.</p>

<p>“But I learned that Professor Snodgrass had
likewise discovered the secret, and was also on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
board here. It became a race between us, and I
had to take precautions—or at least I thought I
did—to prevent him from finding out certain
minor details. That is why I had my cabin
guarded and——”</p>

<p>“Hark!” interrupted Ned, and his feeling of
resentment against his companion was fast vanishing.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the doctor, for the Motor
Boy seemed to be listening intently. “What is
it?”</p>

<p>“Our wireless!” exclaimed Ned. “It’s working
again! Now they can call for help! Hurray!
Our troubles are over!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>THE SEARCH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Standing on the sloping deck of the <i>Altaire</i>,
sloping from a slight list the vessel had assumed
because of a shift of the cargo, Jerry Hopkins and
his fellow refugees stood for a moment looking
at the strange and wonderful sight of the school
of whales attacking the ship. Or, if not attacking,
at least trying to ascertain by bumps of their
huge heads the character of the strange creature
in their midst. And as Jerry’s shout to use the
bow gun rang out, there came another tremor of
the vessel, caused by what seemed the hardest
blow yet delivered.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to scare ’em off or kill some of
’em!” cried Jerry. “They may not intend any
harm, but if they open some of our plates we’ll
go down, sure!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by the bow gun?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“There’s a small gun up forward, put there to
ward off submarine attacks, but it doesn’t seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
have done much good,” explained Jerry quickly.
“It’s mounted on a swivel, and we can depress it
and aim it in almost any direction. There are
some shells too. I saw them when I was looking
about before you came on board. If we give
the whales a shot or two I’m sure they’ll go
away.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do something!” muttered Bob.
“Feel that!”</p>

<p>Again came a tremor of the ship—not one but
several, as though a number of the whales had
attacked at once, acting in concert against what
they may have reasoned was a common enemy.</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s do something!” cried Judd. “I never
saw anything like this in all my life, and I know
something about whales. I never saw so many at
once, and though I’ve known of them sinking
small whaling vessels I never knew ’em to attack
a big steamer. We’ve got to do something!”</p>

<p>“Then come on to the bow gun!” cried Jerry,
and he raised his lantern from where he had lowered
it over the side. The rays were still reflected
from the wet and glistening backs of the
whales as they swam about, now and then one
butting his head against the steel sides of the
<i>Altaire</i>.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass looked on in fascinated
silence. And when Jerry removed the lantern,
thus cutting off a further view of the immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
creatures, the little scientist remarked with something
like a sigh:</p>

<p>“I wish Dr. Hallet could see them.”</p>

<p>“Why, is he particularly interested in whales?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No, not whales particularly. But it would do
him good to see these. It might be the very thing
he needs!”</p>

<p>At the time Bob did not pay much attention to
this remark. But afterward he thought it rather
strange. If Dr. Hallet was not particularly interested
in whales, why should Professor Snodgrass
desire the other scientist to view them? And
why would they do him “good”, if he had no special
object in seeing them?</p>

<p>“I declare,” mused Bob, “the further you go
into this thing the more mysterious it gets. I wonder
what the real explanation of the feeling between
Professor Snodgrass and Dr. Hallet is.
I’ll wager we haven’t yet begun to get to the bottom
of it!”</p>

<p>However, these thoughts came later. Just
then the vital need of the moment was to deal
with the whales, and this Jerry proposed to do by
means of the bow gun.</p>

<p>Hurrying forward, carrying the lantern, while
above them glowed the signal fires of distress,
Bob, Jerry, and Judd came to the bow gun. It
was of three-inch calibre, and capable of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
aimed in any direction, and also pointed, at a
sharp angle, almost directly into the water at either
side of the bow of the ship. It could be trained
aft, too, and as it was mounted high there was
considerable radius of action allowed.</p>

<p>“Where’s the ammunition?” cried Bob, just as
another whale took a head-on bang at the ship.</p>

<p>“In the box near the gun,” answered Jerry, putting
down his lantern. The night was calm, and
a moon gave some illumination now, having
emerged from behind a cloud bank, so the three
could see fairly well what they were doing. Professor
Snodgrass, however, was not of the least
service. When Jerry set the lantern down on the
deck the little scientist took a position near it, and
there he began making notes, whether about the
whales or some minute insect, no one inquired.</p>

<p>The familiarity of Bob and Jerry with weapons
of war stood them in good stead now. With the
help of Judd they loaded the three-inch gun and
aimed it into the midst of the school of whales,
which were then congregated on the port side of
the bow.</p>

<p>“Shall I fire?” asked Jerry, as he stood in readiness.</p>

<p>“Let her go!” called Bob.</p>

<p>There was a sharp report and the shell was sent
into the midst of the whales. That it did execution
was disclosed when the lantern was lowered over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the side by means of a rope and the white, foaming
water was seen to be red for a considerable
area.</p>

<p>“They’ve sounded!” cried the sailor, giving information
in this term that the whales had sunk
below the surface. “I guess we’ve scared ’em
off!”</p>

<p>But it was for a moment only. A little later
there were bumpings and thumps on the other side
of the craft, and the gun was again fired into the
midst of the huge bodies. Once more the lantern
showed red water, and then a commotion in the
sea some distance away told the voyagers that the
school of whales was departing. Several must
have been killed and others wounded, the others
being frightened off.</p>

<p>The bow gun was effective, for though a watch
was kept the rest of the night there was no further
trouble. The <i>Altaire</i> drifted slowly on, and when
morning dawned the refugees came up on deck and
looked about the horizon for a sight of some rescuing
craft.</p>

<p>“We have the whole place to ourselves,” remarked
Jerry, grimly joking as he viewed the
waste of waters.</p>

<p>“Yes, it isn’t a bit crowded,” agreed Bob.
“Well, let’s have breakfast.”</p>

<p>In one sense the plight of the castaways was not
at all bad. They had shelter, plenty of food, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
weather was ideal, now that the fog had gone, and
they were again clothed in their own garments
which had dried out. Nor was there any great
immediate danger. The period of long-continued
storms had not yet come, their derelict, disabled
as she was, was in fairly staunch condition, and
unless some accident happened she might float for
a long time.</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to get sail on her,” decided Jerry
after a breakfast which was cooked by Bob and
of which every one had an ample portion.</p>

<p>With the aid and advice of Judd something resembling
a sail was hoisted and then the hand
steering gear was connected up, after a fashion.</p>

<p>“Now we’re on our way!” cried Jerry, when
the derelict began to move with considerable speed
compared to her former progress. The wind was
west, and was blowing them back toward France.
But this was the best they could hope for. They
could only sail directly before such breezes as
might favor them. Navigation was out of the
question.</p>

<p>So they settled down for a stay, of how long
they knew not, on the derelict. Jerry had not had
time to explore the craft much before the arrival
of his friends, and this lack was now made up for,
once the sail was set. It was found that the <i>Altaire</i>
had sailed from New York with a general
cargo consigned to various English firms. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
it was evident that she had been intercepted and
partly looted by a German submarine. What had
become of her crew and her passengers, if she
carried any (and there were accommodations for
a few) was problematical. But the <i>Altaire</i> made
a good sea home for the refugees.</p>

<p>While Bob, Jerry, Professor Snodgrass, and
Judd were thus making the best of it on the derelict
and eagerly watching for some vessel that
might rescue them, Ned Slade and his fellow voyagers
on the <i>Sherman</i> were buoyed up with new
hope as the word went cheeringly through the craft
that the wireless was again working.</p>

<p>The snapping sparks of it had interrupted the
talk between Ned and Dr. Hallet, and it was some
time before they had a chance to renew the conversation.</p>

<p>For as soon as it became known that signals
could again be sent out, giving the position of the
disabled troopship and asking that aid be rushed,
that was the only topic of moment among all on
board.</p>

<p>“How soon will some ship come to our aid?”</p>

<p>Again and again the call was sent out into space,
and in less than an hour there was a cheer from
the vicinity of the wireless room.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Ned of some of his soldier
chums.</p>

<p>“They’ve received our calls!” cried a young lieutenant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
“Three of Uncle Sam’s warships are racing
toward us at top speed. Now we’re all
right!”</p>

<p>And the good news was true. Working night
and day, often at great personal risk, the engine
room force had managed to rig up a boiler,
get steam to an engine, and so whirl the dynamo
that furnished the current for the powerful wireless
spark. The operators had done the rest.</p>

<p>Forth into the air had gone the mystic signals,
and this time they had been heard and understood
by many receivers both on shore and at sea. It
did not take long to flash the news to the proper
quarters, and from Brest, the very port from which
the <i>Sherman</i> had departed, aid was rushed to her.
The position was accurately given—as accurately
as can be on a boundless sea—and the rest had to
be left to fate.</p>

<p>In record-breaking time the rescuing convoy was
sighted, and then joyous scenes took place on board
the <i>Sherman</i>.</p>

<p>Soon after the first enthusiasm had worn off,
though, the question arose as to what was the next
thing to do. The war-weary soldiers wanted to
get back home—to Uncle Sam’s country.</p>

<p>But this problem was easily solved. The war
vessels had orders to take on board all the passengers
and proceed with them to the United
States. The <i>Sherman</i> would be towed back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Brest for repairs, and on board her a crew would
have to remain to look after the ship. Every one
else, however, was transferred to one or another
of the three war vessels that arrived about the
same time. The baggage, too, was transferred,
much to the satisfaction of the returning soldiers.</p>

<p>“Is there anything that can be done to see if
Jerry and Bob are alive?” asked Ned of his captain,
when they, together with their comrades and
fellow officers, were on board the warship.</p>

<p>“Do you think it possible they may be alive?”
the captain asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” declared Ned, “improbable as it seems,
I feel that Bob and Jerry, as well as Professor
Snodgrass, are alive. Perhaps that missing sailor
is, too. They may have been cast into the sea
when the derelict crashed into us, and they may
have managed to keep afloat either on some of the
wreckage of the <i>Sherman</i> that was torn off, or on
a bit of the derelict. She was smashed, too, I believe.
Can’t we make a search for Jerry and the
others?”</p>

<p>“I’ll see,” said the captain. And he used his
influence to such good advantage that it was soon
after announced to Ned and others that before
proceeding to America a search would be made by
all three warships for the missing soldiers, the
professor, and the sailor.</p>

<p>“We’s going to try to locate the derelict, too,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Ned’s captain told him. “Such craft are a terrible
menace to other ships, and they are sunk wherever
found. I am sorry to say no one but you seems
to have much faith that we shall find your friends,
but as a matter of precaution, if nothing else, a
search will be made for the derelict. As she can
only drift, and as Jerry and the others could only
drift, in case they managed to keep afloat on some
wreckage, it is possible we may find them in the
vicinity of whatever vessel it was that crashed into
us in the fog.”</p>

<p>And so the search began; a wearying and
anxious search over the broad sea.</p>

<small>“DERELICT AHOY!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ned Slade and Dr. Hallet were aboard one of
the rescuing warships. There was a time, just
before the wireless of the <i>Sherman</i> was reëstablished,
when it seemed to Ned that he was going
to learn Dr. Hallet’s secret, and when he felt that
he could be on terms of friendship with the eccentric
doctor—who was not a physician, but a doctor
of science.</p>

<p>However, since the two had been transferred to
the same warship there had been a complete change
in Dr. Hallet. Far from seeking a chance to
maintain friendly relations with Ned, the doctor
avoided the Motor Boy and remained in seclusion.
Nor did he send any word or give any explanation
of what he had started to say as to his relations
with Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, after a few glimpses of
Dr. Hallet, following their transfer from the
<i>Sherman</i>, the Motor Boy did not again see the
scientist. The latter, Ned learned, was busy over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
his notebooks and memoranda, which he had
brought with him, together with his fleas and other
specimens from the troopship.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” said Ned to a soldier
chum. “He was just getting friendly with me
when we were in the midst of our troubles, and
now, when we’re safe, he doesn’t speak to me.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go to him and ask for a showdown?”
inquired Sam Harden, the lad with whom
Ned was becoming chummy.</p>

<p>“I’ve tried to, but he won’t see me. And I
can’t very well force myself on him. I don’t know
any of the officers who are on board well enough
to go to them and tell them all that’s happened.
They might laugh at me, and Dr. Hallet might
turn ugly again, as he can on occasion.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think he tried to damage the
<i>Sherman</i>?” asked Harden.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t say that I do—now,” Ned confessed.
“But he surely did act queer. And why
he should hate, or pretend to hate, Professor
Snodgrass is more than I can fathom.</p>

<p>“But there’s nothing I can do, I suppose, except
wait. If we ever find Jerry, Bob, and the
professor I may get an explanation. And I certainly
do hope we find them!”</p>

<p>“Same here!” echoed his new chum. “They’re
making a good search of it.”</p>

<p>This was true. The three warships which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
carrying home the troops transferred from the
<i>Sherman</i> kept together and in a sort of line swept
forward over the sea, cruising about in search of
the derelict or for a possible sight of refugees
drifting on wreckage. To this end searchlights
were kept aglow all night, and soldiers or sailors
were constantly on watch during the twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile life aboard the <i>Altaire</i> was far from
being dangerous now. The attack of the whales
had done no harm, and in the broad daylight Jerry
rather wondered whether they had not acted foolishly
in firing the bow gun at the creatures.</p>

<p>“I don’t really believe they could have rammed
us hard enough to have done any damage,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Well, it certainly felt so,” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“And I’m just as glad we drove them away,”
said Judd.</p>

<p>As for Professor Snodgrass, he said little. He
was too much occupied in classifying and making
notes of the various forms of life he found on
the bunch of seaweed he had brought on board
with him.</p>

<p>Aside from attending now and then to the rude
sail that had been hoisted, and steering the craft,
which did not require much effort, as she did not
move rapidly, there was nothing to do on the derelict
except, as Bob said, “to get meals and eat ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course the distress signals were kept flying
by day, and the lanterns at night gave notice to
whoever might glimpse them that they were carried
by a craft which needed help for those on board.
And outside of seeing that these signals and lights
were kept in place, there was nothing that could
be done.</p>

<p>It was utterly impossible for the four to start
the engines. The small sail was their only motive
power. There was no need of using the steam
pumps, for the <i>Altaire</i> was not leaking save in
one or two compartments, and the water-tight
bulkheads kept the sea from invading other parts
of the craft. Even had it been necessary to get
steam up for the pumps, it is doubtful if it could
have been managed.</p>

<p>All they could do was to wait and hope, and
this was wearying enough after the first week.</p>

<p>Each morning they began a vigil that lasted all
day, and even into the night, for they knew the
lights of an approaching vessel could be seen farther
after dark than could the form of the ship
itself during the day. But they sighted nothing.</p>

<p>It was more than a week after the crash which
resulted in the separation of the Motor Boys
when, on a wonderfully clear day, a lookout
aboard the war craft containing Ned sent forth
a thrilling cry from the crow’s nest.</p>

<p>“Derelict ahoy!” he shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where away?”</p>

<p>“Dead ahead!”</p>

<p>And then Ned and the others, rushing to vantage
points, saw the <i>Altaire</i>.</p>

<p>There she was, slowly rolling to and fro on a
gentle swell, and no sooner had officers and sailors
of the rescuing vessel caught sight of her than
they raised a cry of:</p>

<p>“Some one’s on board!”</p>

<p>The distress signals told that.</p>

<p>And about the same time Jerry, Bob, the professor,
and Judd, grouped at the rail, were frantically
waving their hands and shouting. For they
had seen the oncoming war craft, and knew that
they were saved.</p>

<p>The weary search was over.</p>

<p>“And what happened to you? Did the <i>Sherman</i>
sink?”</p>

<p>It was Ned who asked the first question, Jerry
who propounded the second. And then he and
Ned and Bob clasped hands while about them
stood a circle of cheering sailors and soldiers on
board the war vessel.</p>

<p>A boat had been sent to bring the refugees from
the <i>Altaire</i>, and when Jerry and his chums were
safe on board and the cruiser had moved sufficiently
far away to be out of danger, the derelict
was blown up. Afloat she would be a constant
menace to navigation, and it was impossible to
salvage her.</p>

<p>It was following this necessary destruction of
what had once been a fine vessel that Ned and
Jerry questioned one another.</p>

<p>Then came explanations. Jerry told how he
had managed to get aboard the derelict, and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
he had been joined by Bob, the professor, and
Judd. And, in his turn, Ned described the life
aboard the transport, his talk with Dr. Hallet, and
their transfer to the warship.</p>

<p>“Where is Dr. Hallet now?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“He’s shut up in his cabin, I imagine,” answered
Ned. “Somehow, he managed to get a
cabin to himself. He seems to avoid me. I declare
I don’t know what it all means.”</p>

<p>At that moment a steward approached Professor
Snodgrass, who was standing in the group that
included Ned, Bob and Jerry.</p>

<p>“Dr. Hallet wishes to see you,” the steward
said to Professor Snodgrass. “He has heard of
your rescue.”</p>

<p>“Wishes to see me!” exclaimed the little scientist.
“Dear me, this is rather extraordinary! I
don’t know whether to see him or not!”</p>

<p>“The surgeon told me to tell you, sir,” added
the steward, “that Dr. Hallet is perfectly normal
again. All his trouble has gone, and he is himself
once more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, in that case of course I’ll see him!” exclaimed
the professor. “It’s all right, boys!” he
added to Bob and Jerry. “He must have had the
necessary shock to bring back his reason. I hope
it will never leave him again. I’ll go to see him
at once. I am rejoiced to hear this good news!”</p>

<p>As the professor hurried away Ned looked curiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
at his two chums. Then he began to question
them.</p>

<p>“Say, what’s it all about?” he asked. “What
does the professor mean when he says Dr. Hallet
has recovered his reason? Has he been crazy?”
burst out Ned.</p>

<p>“Practically so, yes, though harmless,” said
Jerry. “The professor explained everything to
us while we were on the <i>Altaire</i>. Did you begin
to suspect anything?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know what to think, nor what to expect
or suspect,” answered Ned. “At one time
Dr. Hallet seemed about to tell me everything,
and explain a lot of queer circumstances. Then
something happened—I think it was when our
wireless got to working—and there was too much
excitement to think of anything but a rescue. Since
we’ve been on this warship the doctor has avoided
me. I declare I didn’t know what to think.”</p>

<p>“Nor did we until the professor explained,”
said Jerry. “It seems we were all wrong in our
conjectures, but it wasn’t exactly our fault, for
the doctor’s trouble made him irresponsible.”</p>

<p>“Does that account for his talk against the professor
in the restaurant, and why he had a guard
at his cabin?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer from Bob, while Jerry
said:</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you the yarn, Ned. All our troubles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
are over now, I hope. We had enough of them
while they lasted, and at one time it seemed as if
we were all booked for Davy Jones’ locker. But
here we are, and we’ll soon be back home where
we can live life as it ought to be lived.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have our meals on time, for one thing,”
declared Bob.</p>

<p>“And the folks will be glad to see us,” added
Jerry.</p>

<p>“And perhaps some others than just our <em>folks</em>,”
put in Ned, with a smile. He was thinking of
girls, and, perchance, one in particular.</p>

<p>The story Jerry told, having had it from Professor
Snodgrass, was to the effect that Dr. Hallet
had once been a colleague of the little scientist
with whom the Motor Boys had made so many
trips. When the war broke out and Professor
Snodgrass went to Europe to study the effect of
battle noises on certain insects, Dr. Hallet made
a like voyage to take up another branch of science.
In some lines he and Professor Snodgrass were
associated, working to the same end. In other
lines they differed radically, and often violently,
though they were always good friends and helped
one another.</p>

<p>Dr. Hallet went too near the front toward the
close of the war, and was under fire. He suffered
from shell shock, which affected his mind, and
among his hallucinations was one in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
imagined that Professor Snodgrass was his enemy
and was trying to obtain a certain scientific secret
from him.</p>

<p>In order to effect, if possible, a cure of his
friend, Professor Snodgrass, on the advice of the
physicians treating Dr. Hallet, did not dispute
this false idea. On the contrary he even encouraged
it. The state of mind of the doctor accounted
for his violent talk against the professor
in the restaurant, and his queer actions led Marie,
the pretty waitress, to give the queer scientist the
name of “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cochon</i>.” Of course that was not
deserved.</p>

<p>“Did Dr. Hallet try to blow up the ship?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Of course not!” exclaimed Jerry. “That time
we met him with the black box he imagined he was
concealing some insects from the gaze of Professor
Snodgrass, and also from us. He included us
in his fear, it seems. There never was a bomb on
the ship. All the accidents were due to defects in
the machinery—the bursting of steam pipes and
the like.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve since heard that,” Ned admitted.
“But I didn’t know whether or not Dr. Hallet
might not have tried to set off a bomb.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like it!” laughed Jerry. “We were
all wrong in thinking him that sort of man. He
did act queerly, but it was because he was suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
from shell shock. And he made such a fuss
about the chance that Professor Snodgrass might
steal some scientific secrets that Captain Munson,
at the doctor’s request and on the professor’s advice,
posted a guard in front of the stateroom.
It was not needed, of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, how did it happen we saw Professor
Snodgrass in there?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“He went in to see if he could not quiet the
doctor, who had a sort of hysterical fit,” explained
Jerry. “The ship’s surgeon suggested this. Professor
Snodgrass also looked over some of the
doctor’s papers and examined his specimens,
hoping, thereby, to get a line on something that
might turn his mind into a new channel. It was
then we saw him. But he did not see us. Dr.
Hallet closed the door quickly.</p>

<p>“But nothing seemed to answer; though, after
a while, the doctor himself seemed to quiet down.
He requested the guards to be taken away, and
this was done. Then came the crash, and what
happened to him since I don’t know. At the time
the whales attacked us Professor Snodgrass said
he wished Dr. Hallet could see them. He thought
perhaps interest in them would give him the necessary
shock which would bring back his reason.”</p>

<p>“Well, something must have happened to him,”
said Ned. “He acted almost rational with me
after you and the professor were lost overboard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
As I said, two or three times he was on the verge
of telling me something, but I can realize now
that he was not normal. Then, after we were
transferred to this warship, he acted strangely
again.”</p>

<p>“But he is all right now,” said Professor Snodgrass,
who came on deck again after a visit to his
colleague. “His mind has cleared, and we are
again united friends. He realizes what he has
gone through, but he has no complete idea of how
queerly he acted.”</p>

<p>“What brought back his mind?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I suppose the various shocks connected with
the accidents to the <i>Sherman</i> and the search for
the derelict all acted on him in a beneficial way,”
replied the professor. “At any rate, after having
been irrational, he is himself again, and the
surgeon assures me there will be no more trouble.”</p>

<p>Both Dr. Hallet and Professor Snodgrass were
allowed on the troopship because of exceptional
services rendered the government during the war.
Professor Snodgrass had captured a number of
Germans, as detailed in the book preceding this.
As for Dr. Hallet, he had discovered a method of
combating one of the German poison gases.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass, because of the mental attitude
of Dr. Hallet, had come on board the transport
quietly, which accounted for the fact that the
boys did not see him for some days. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
professor was so engrossed with various matters
that he was not aware of the presence of Ned,
Bob and Jerry. Captain Munson knew something
about the condition of Dr. Hallet, and also the
efforts Professor Snodgrass was making to cure
his friend, but he did not feel at liberty to discuss
it with the Motor Boys. That is why he
spoke to Ned as he did when the doctor started to
make an explanation.</p>

<p>“But there will be nothing more to worry
about,” declared the professor, concluding his explanations.</p>

<p>Nor was there. Dr. Hallet, though a bit dazed
by what he had gone through and having very little
real knowledge of his actions following the
shell shock, rapidly grew to be himself again. He
and Professor Snodgrass joined forces in making
scientific observations while the warship bore them
and the others homeward. And from the time the
professor and the doctor resumed their old relations
the Motor Boys saw little of them. For the
two scientists were constantly catching specimens,
from cockroaches to sea-leeches, and making
learned notes and observations regarding them.</p>

<p>“And to think all our theories about the doctor
being a bomber were hot air!” exclaimed Bob, as
they stood on deck after the good news had been
scattered that another day would see them at New
York. “We certainly were barking up the wrong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
tree! It was Marie that gave the wrong idea, in
a way. But she didn’t mean to. Mighty fine girl,
Marie!” and Bob sighed.</p>

<p>“Here! None of that!” warned Jerry. “I’ll
tell Helena.”</p>

<p>“All right! You do, and I’ll whisper something
to Mollie Horton about the French girl who tied
up your sore finger!” countered the stout lad.</p>

<p>“Better call it a draw,” suggested Ned with a
laugh.</p>

<p>And so, as the old proverb has it: “All’s well
that ends well.”</p>

<p>And certainly matters ended well for the Motor
Boys. The next day the warship anchored off
quarantine, and in due time Jerry and his friends
went ashore and were sent to a demobilization
camp. There they obtained furloughs and went
home to Cresville, where an enthusiastic reception
awaited them.</p>

<p>They told of their parts in the Great War, but
they liked best to relate the story of the wreck of
the troopship, for it was like some wonderful
romance, and the terrors of the battlefield were
not involved.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know the story of the <i>Altaire</i>,” said
Ned, one day. And later he and his chums heard
it.</p>

<p>The freighter was attacked by a submarine and
her few passengers and crew forced to take to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the small boats. Then the Germans took what
they wanted in the way of supplies and were about
to sink the <i>Altaire</i> when they saw a United States
destroyer looming on the horizon. The submarine
fled before being able to place any bombs,
though her crew partly wrecked the engine room
and destroyed the wireless plant.</p>

<p>The destroyer picked up the crew of the <i>Altaire</i>,
but soon after that a storm came up, and
there was no chance to salvage the vessel. It was
thought that she had sunk, but, fortunately for
Jerry and his three companions, she remained
afloat. Thus the mystery was cleared.</p>

<p>“But there’s one thing I’m never going to do if
we have another war,” declared Ned, as the three
chums found a moment to be by themselves after
a round of meeting old friends.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I’m never going to be surprised at what a bug-hunting
professor does,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Same here!” echoed Jerry.</p>

<p>And so, the three young soldiers were safe at
home, though they had come a perilous way to get
there. And now we shall take leave—at least for
a time—of Ned, Bob and Jerry.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
